And as she thus lamented , some one said to her , “ What ails you , King ’ s Daughter ?
You weep so that even a stone would show pity . ” She looked round to the side from whence the voice came , and saw a Frog stretching its thick , ugly head from the water .
“ Ah !
old water-splasher , is it you ? ” said she ; “ I am weeping for my golden ball , which has fallen into the fountain . ” “ Be quiet , and do not weep , ” answered the Frog , “ I can help you .
But what will you give me if I bring your plaything up again ? ” “ Whatever you will have , dear Frog , ” said she-- “ my clothes , my pearls and jewels , and even the golden crown which I am wearing . ” The Frog answered , “ I do not care for your clothes , your pearls and jewels , or your golden crown , but if you will love me and let me be your companion and playfellow , and sit by you at your little table , and eat off your little golden plate , and drink out of your little cup , and sleep in your little bed--if you will promise me this , I will go down below , and bring your golden ball up again . ” “ Oh , yes , ” said she , “ I promise you all you wish , if you will but bring my ball back again . ” She , however , thought , “ How the silly Frog does talk !
He lives in the water with the other frogs and croaks , and can be no companion to any human being ! ” But the Frog , when he had received this promise , put his head into the water and sank down .
In a short time he came swimming up again with the ball in his mouth , and threw it on the grass .
The King ’ s Daughter was delighted to see her pretty plaything once more , and picked it up , and ran away with it .
“ Wait , wait , ” said the Frog .
“ Take me with you .
I can ’ t run as you can . ” But what did it avail him to scream his _ croak , croak , _ after her , as loudly as he could ?
She did not listen to it , but ran home and soon forgot the poor Frog , who was forced to go back into his fountain again .
The next day , when she had seated herself at table with the King and all the courtiers , and was eating from her little golden plate , something came creeping _ splish splash , splish splash , _ up the marble staircase .
When it got to the top , it knocked at the door , and cried : “ _ King ’ s Daughter , youngest .
Open the door ! _ ” She ran to see who was outside , but when she opened the door , there sat the Frog in front of it .
Then she slammed the door in great haste , sat down to dinner again , and was quite frightened .
The King saw plainly that her heart was beating violently , and said , “ My Child , what are you so afraid of ?
Is there a Giant outside who wants to carry you away ? ” “ Ah , no , ” replied she , “ it is no Giant , but a disgusting Frog . ” “ What does the Frog want with you ? ” “ Ah , dear Father , yesterday when I was in the forest sitting by the fountain , playing , my golden ball fell into the water .
And because I cried so , the Frog brought it out again for me .
And because he insisted so on it , I promised him he should be my companion ; but I never thought he would be able to come out of the water !
And now he is here , and wants to come in . ” In the meantime , it knocked a second time , and cried : “ _ King ’ s Daughter , youngest !
Open to me !
Don ’ t you remember yesterday , And all that you to me did say , Beside the cooling fountain ’ s spray ?
King ’ s Daughter , youngest !
Open to me ! _ ” Then said the King , “ That which you have promised you must perform .
Go and let him in . ” She went and opened the door , and the Frog hopped in and followed her , step by step , to her chair .
There he sat still and cried , “ Lift me up beside you . ” She delayed , until at last the King commanded her to do it .
When the Frog was once on the chair , he wanted to be on the table , and when he was on the table , he said , “ Now , push your little golden plate nearer to me that we may eat together . ” She did this , but it was easy to see that she did not do it willingly .
The Frog enjoyed what he ate , but almost every mouthful she took , choked her .
At length he said , “ I have eaten and am satisfied .
Now I am tired , carry me into your little room and make your little silken bed ready ; and we will both lie down and go to sleep . ” The King ’ s Daughter began to cry , for she was afraid of the cold Frog , which she did not like to touch , and which was now to sleep in her pretty , clean little bed .
But the King grew angry and said , “ He who helped you when you were in trouble , ought not afterward to be despised . ” So she took hold of the Frog with two fingers , carried him upstairs , and put him in a corner .
But when she was in bed , he crept to her and said , “ I am tired , I want to sleep as well as you ; lift me up or I will tell your father . ” Then she was terribly angry , and took him up and threw him with all her might against the wall .
“ Now , you will be quiet , odious Frog , ” said she .
But when he fell down , he was no Frog but a King ’ s Son with beautiful kind eyes !
He , by her father ’ s will , was now her dear companion and husband .
Then he told her how he had been bewitched by a wicked Witch , and how no one could have delivered him from the fountain but herself , and that to-morrow they would go together into his kingdom .
Then they went to sleep , and next morning when the sun awoke them , a coach came rolling up drawn by eight white horses , with white ostrich feathers on their heads .
They were harnessed with golden chains , and behind stood the young King ’ s servant , Faithful Henry .
Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when his master was changed into a Frog , that he had three iron bands laid round his heart , lest it should burst with grief and sadness .
The coach was to conduct the young King into his kingdom .
Faithful Henry helped them both in , and placed himself behind again , and was full of joy because of this deliverance .
And when they had driven a part of the way , the King ’ s Son heard a cracking behind him as if something had broken .
So he turned round and cried : “ _ Henry , the coach does break ! _ ” “ _ No , no , my lord , you do mistake !
It is the band around my heart , That felt such great and bitter smart , When you were in the fountain strange , When you into a Frog were changed ! _ ” Again and once again , while they were on their way , something cracked ; and each time the King ’ s Son thought the carriage was breaking .
But it was only the bands which were springing from the heart of Faithful Henry because his master was set free and was happy .
&#91; Illustration &#93; THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS There was once on a time , an old Goat who had seven little Kids , and loved them with all the love of a mother for her children .
One day , she wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food .
So she called all seven to her and said , “ Dear Children , I have to go into the forest .
Be on your guard against the Wolf .
If he come in , he will devour you all--skin , hair , and all .
The wretch often disguises himself ; but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet . ” The Kids said , “ Dear Mother , we will take good care of ourselves .
You may go away without any anxiety . ” Then the old one bleated , and went on her way with an easy mind .
It was not long before some one knocked at the house-door , and cried , “ Open the door , dear Children !
Your mother is here , and has brought something back with her for each of you . ” But the little Kids knew that it was the Wolf , by his rough voice .
“ We will not open the door , ” cried they ; “ you are not our mother .
She has a soft , pleasant voice , but your voice is rough .
You are the Wolf ! ” Then the Wolf went away to a shopkeeper , and bought a great lump of chalk , ate this and made his voice soft with it .
Then he came back , knocked at the door of the house , and cried , “ Open the door , dear Children !
Your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you . ” But the Wolf had laid his black paws against the window , and the children saw them , and cried , “ We will not open the door , our mother has not black feet like you .
You are the Wolf ! ” Then the Wolf ran to a baker , and said , “ I have hurt my feet , rub some dough over them for me . ” And when the baker had rubbed his feet over , he ran to the miller and said , “ Strew some white meal over my feet for me . ” The miller thought to himself , “ The Wolf wants to deceive some one , ” and refused .
But the Wolf said , “ If you will not do it , I will devour you . ” Then the miller was afraid , and made his paws white for him .
Yes !
so are men !
Now , the wretch went for the third time to the house-door , knocked at it , and said , “ Open the door for me , Children !
Your dear little mother has come home , and has brought every one of you something from the forest with her . ” The little Kids cried , “ First show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother . ” Then he put his paws in through the window .
And when the Kids saw that they were white , they believed all that he said , and opened the door .
But who should come in but _ the Wolf _ !
&#91; Illustration : THE LITTLE KIDS CRIED , “ FIRST SHOW US YOUR PAWS ” &#93; They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves .
One sprang under the table , the second into the bed , the third into the stove , the fourth into the kitchen , the fifth into the cupboard , the sixth under the washing-bowl , and the seventh into the clock-case .
But the Wolf found them all and made no delay , but swallowed one after the other down his throat .
The youngest in the clock-case was the only one he did not find .
When the Wolf had satisfied his appetite , he took himself off , laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside , and began to sleep .
Soon afterward , the old Goat came home again from the forest .
Ah !
what a sight she saw there !
The house-door stood wide open .
The table , chairs , and benches were thrown down , the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces , and the quilts and pillows were pulled off the bed .
She sought her children , but they were nowhere to be found .
She called them one after another by name , but no one answered .
At last , when she called the youngest , a soft voice cried , “ Dear Mother , I am in the clock-case . ” She took the Kid out , and it told her that the Wolf had come and had eaten all the others .
Then you may imagine how she wept over her poor children !
At length , in her grief she went out , and the youngest Kid ran with her .
When they came to the meadow , there lay the Wolf by the tree and he was snoring so loud that the branches shook .
She looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his stomach .
“ Ah ! ” said she , “ is it possible that my poor children , whom he has swallowed down for his supper , can be still alive ? ” Then the Kid had to run home and fetch scissors , and a needle and thread , and the Goat cut open the monster ’ s stomach .
Hardly had she made one cut , than a little Kid thrust its head out , and when she had cut farther , all six sprang out one after another , and were all still alive , and had suffered no hurt whatever , for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them whole .
What rejoicing there was !
They embraced their dear mother , and jumped like a tailor at his wedding .
The mother , however , said , “ Now go and look for some big stones .
We will fill the wicked beast ’ s stomach with them , while he is asleep . ” Then the seven Kids dragged the stones thither with all speed , and put as many of them into his stomach as they could get in .
And the mother sewed him up again in the greatest haste ; so that he was not aware of anything and never once stirred .
When the Wolf had had his sleep out , he got on his legs , and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty , he wanted to go to a well to drink .
But when he began to walk and to move about , the stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled .
Then cried he : “ _ What rumbles and tumbles Against my poor bones ?
I thought ’ twas six Kids , But it ’ s only big stones ! _ ” And when he got to the well and stooped over the water and was just about to drink , the heavy stones made him fall in .
There was no help for it , but he had to drown miserably !
When the seven Kids saw that , they came running to the spot and cried aloud , “ The Wolf is dead !
The Wolf is dead ! ” and danced for joy round about the well with their mother .
&#91; Illustration &#93; RAPUNZEL There was once a man and a woman , who had long in vain wished for a child .
At length , the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire .
These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen .
It was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs .
It was , however , surrounded by a high wall , and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to a Witch , who had great power and was dreaded by all the world .
One day , the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden , when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion ( rapunzel ) , and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it , and had the greatest desire to eat some .
This desire increased every day , and as she knew that she could not get any of it , she quite pined away , and looked pale and miserable .
Then her husband was alarmed , and asked , “ What ails you , dear Wife ? ” “ Ah , ” she replied , “ if I can ’ t get some of the rampion to eat , which is in the garden behind our house , I shall die . ” The man , who loved her , thought , “ Sooner than let your wife die , bring her some of the rampion yourself , let it cost you what it will ! ” In the twilight of evening , he clambered over the wall into the garden of the Witch , hastily clutched a handful of rampion , and took it to his wife .
She at once made herself a salad of it , and ate it with much relish .
She , however , liked it so much--so very much--that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before .
If he was to have any rest , her husband must once more descend into the garden .
In the gloom of evening , therefore , he let himself down again .
But when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid , for he saw the Witch standing before him .
“ How dare you , ” said she with angry look , “ descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief ?
You shall suffer for it ! ” “ Ah , ” answered he , “ let mercy take the place of justice !
I had to do it out of necessity .
My wife saw your rampion from the window , and felt such a longing for it that she would have died , if she had not got some to eat . ” Then the Witch let her anger be softened , and said to him , “ If the case be as you say , I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will , only I make one condition , you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world .
It shall be well treated , and I will care for it like a mother . ” The man in his terror consented to everything , and when the woman at last had a little daughter , the Witch appeared at once , gave the child the name of Rapunzel , and took it away with her .
Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child beneath the sun .
When she was twelve years old , the Witch shut her into a tower , which lay in a forest , and had neither stairs nor door .
But quite at the top was a little window .
When the Witch wanted to go in , she placed herself beneath this , and cried : “ _ Rapunzel , Rapunzel , Let down thy hair . _ ” Rapunzel had magnificent long hair , fine as spun gold , and when she heard the voice of the Witch , she unfastened her braided tresses and wound them round one of the hooks of the window above .
And then the hair fell twenty ells down , and the Witch climbed up by it .
After a year or two , it came to pass that the King ’ s Son rode through the forest and went by the tower .
Then he heard a song , which was so charming that he stood still and listened .
This was Rapunzel , who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound .
The King ’ s Son wanted to climb up to her , and looked for the door of the tower , but none was to be found .
He rode home , but the singing had so deeply touched his heart , that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it .
Once when he was thus standing behind a tree , he saw that a Witch came there , and he heard how she cried : “ _ Rapunzel , Rapunzel , Let down thy hair . _ ” Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair , and the Witch climbed up to her .
“ If that is the ladder by which one mounts , I will for once try my fortune , ” said he .
The next day when it began to grow dark , he went to the tower and cried : “ _ Rapunzel , Rapunzel , Let down thy hair . _ ” Immediately the hair fell down , and the King ’ s Son climbed up .
At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man , such as her eyes had never yet beheld , came to her .
But the King ’ s Son began to talk to her quite like a friend , and told her that his heart had been so stirred , that it had let him have no rest , so he had been forced to see her .
Then Rapunzel lost her fear , and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband , and she saw that he was young and handsome , she thought , “ He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does ; ” and she said yes , and laid her hand in his .
She said also , “ I will willingly go away with you , but I do not know how to get down .
Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come , and I will weave a ladder with it .
When that is ready I will descend , and you will take me on your horse . ” They agreed that until that time , he should come to her every evening , for the old woman came by day .
The Witch remarked nothing of this , until once Rapunzel said to her , “ Tell me , Dame Gothel , how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up , than the young King ’ s Son--he is with me in a moment . ” “ Ah !
you wicked Child ! ” cried the Witch .
“ What do I hear you say !
I thought I had separated you from all the world , and yet you have deceived me ! ” In her anger she clutched Rapunzel ’ s beautiful tresses , wrapped them twice round her left hand , seized a pair of scissors with the right , and _ snip , snap , _ they were cut off , and the lovely braids lay on the ground .
And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert , where she had to live in great grief and misery .
On the same day , however , that she cast out Rapunzel , the Witch , in the evening , fastened the braids of hair which she had cut off , to the hook of the window ; and when the King ’ s Son came and cried : “ _ Rapunzel , Rapunzel , Let down thy hair , _ ” she let the hair down .
The King ’ s Son ascended .
He did not find his dearest Rapunzel above , but the Witch , who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks .
“ Aha ! ” she cried mockingly , “ you would fetch your dearest !
But the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest .
The cat has got it , and will scratch out your eyes as well .
Rapunzel is lost to you !
You will never see her more ! ” The King ’ s Son was beside himself with grief and in his despair he leapt down from the tower .
He escaped with his life , but the thorns into which he fell , pierced his eyes .
Then he wandered quite blind about the forest , ate nothing but roots and berries , and did nothing but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife .
Thus he roamed about in misery for some years , and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel lived in wretchedness .
He heard a voice , and it seemed so familiar to him that he went toward it .
When he approached , Rapunzel knew him , and fell on his neck and wept .
Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again , and he could see with them as before .
He led her to his Kingdom where he was joyfully received , and they lived for a long time , happy and contented .
&#91; Illustration &#93; LITTLE BROTHER AND LITTLE SISTER Little brother took his little sister by the hand and said , “ Since our mother died , we have had no happiness ; our stepmother beats us every day , and if we come near her , she kicks us away with her foot .
Our meals are the hard crusts of bread that are left over .
The little dog under the table is better off , for she often throws it a nice bit .
May Heaven pity us !
If our mother only knew !
Come , we will go forth together into the wide world . ” They walked the whole day over meadows , fields , and stony places ; and when it rained the little sister said , “ Heaven and our hearts are weeping together . ” In the evening they came to a large forest , and they were so weary with sorrow and hunger and the long walk , that they lay down in a hollow tree and fell asleep .
The next day when they awoke , the sun was already high and shone down hot into the tree .
Then the little brother said , “ Little Sister , I am thirsty .
If I knew of a little brook I would go and take a drink .
I think I hear one running . ” The little brother got up and took the little sister by the hand , and they set off to find the brook .
But the wicked stepmother was a Witch , and had seen how the two children had gone away .
She had crept after them , as Witches do creep , and had bewitched all the brooks in the forest .
Now , when they found a little brook leaping brightly over the stones , the little brother was going to drink out of it , but the little sister heard how it said as it ran : “ _ Who drinks of me , a Tiger be !
Who drinks of me , a Tiger be ! _ ” Then the little sister cried , “ Pray , dear little Brother , do not drink , or you will become a wild beast , and tear me to pieces . ” The little brother did not drink , although he was so thirsty , but said , “ I will wait for the next spring . ” When they came to the next brook , the little sister heard this say : “ _ Who drinks of me , a wild Wolf be !
Who drinks of me , a wild Wolf be ! _ ” Then the little sister cried out , “ Pray , dear little Brother , do not drink , or you will become a Wolf , and devour me . ” The little brother did not drink , and said , “ I will wait until we come to the next spring , but then I must drink , say what you like ; for my thirst is too great . ” And when they came to the third brook , the little sister heard how it said as it ran : “ _ Who drinks of me , a Roebuck be !
Who drinks of me , a Roebuck be ! _ ” The little sister said , “ Oh , I pray you , dear little Brother , do not drink , or you will become a Roe , and run away from me . ” But the little brother had knelt by the brook , and had bent down and drunk some of the water .
And as soon as the first drops touched his lips , he lay there a young Roe .
And now the little sister wept over her poor bewitched little brother , and the little Roe wept also , and sat sorrowfully near to her .
But at last the girl said , “ Be quiet , dear little Roe , I will never , never leave you . ” Then she untied her golden garter and put it round the Roe ’ s neck , and she plucked rushes and wove them into a soft cord .
With this she tied the little animal and led it on ; and she walked deeper and deeper into the forest .
And when they had gone a very long way , they came to a little house .
The girl looked in ; and as it was empty , she thought , “ We can stay here and live . ” Then she sought for leaves and moss to make a soft bed for the Roe .
Every morning she went out and gathered roots and berries and nuts for herself , and brought tender grass for the Roe , who ate out of her hand , and was content and played round about her .
In the evening , when the little sister was tired , and had said her prayer , she laid her head upon the Roe ’ s back : that was her pillow , and she slept softly on it .
And if only the little brother had had his human form , it would have been a delightful life .
For some time , they were alone like this in the wilderness .
But it happened that the King of the country held a great hunt in the forest .
Then the blasts of the horns , the barking of dogs , and the merry shouts of the huntsmen rang through the trees , and the Roe heard all , and was only too anxious to be there .
“ Oh , ” said he to his little sister , “ let me be off to the hunt , I cannot bear it any longer ; ” and he begged so much that at last she agreed .
“ But , ” said she to him , “ come back to me in the evening .
I must shut my door for fear of the rough huntsmen , so knock and say , ‘ My little Sister , let me in ! ’ that I may know you .
And if you do not say that , I shall not open the door . ” Then the young Roe sprang away ; so happy was he and so merry in the open air .
The King and the huntsmen saw the pretty creature , and started after him .
But they could not catch him , and when they thought that they surely had him , away he sprang through the bushes and was gone .
When it was dark he ran to the cottage , knocked , and said , “ My little Sister , let me in . ” Then the door was opened for him , and he jumped in , and rested himself the whole night through upon his soft bed .
The next day , the hunt went on afresh , and when the Roe again heard the bugle-horn , and the _ ho !
ho ! _ of the huntsmen , he had no peace , but said , “ Sister , let me out , I must be off . ” His sister opened the door for him , and said , “ But you must be here again in the evening and say your password . ” When the King and his huntsmen again saw the young Roe with the golden collar , they all chased him , but he was too quick and nimble for them .
This went on for the whole day , but by evening the huntsmen had surrounded him , and one of them wounded him a little in the foot , so that he limped and ran slowly .
Then a hunter crept after him to the cottage and heard how he said , “ My little Sister , let me in , ” and saw that the door was opened for him , and was shut again at once .
The huntsman took notice of it all , and went to the King and told him what he had seen and heard .
Then the King said , “ To-morrow we will hunt once more . ” The little sister , however , was dreadfully frightened when she saw that her little Roe was hurt .
She washed the blood off him , laid herbs on the wound , and said , “ Go to your bed , dear Roe , that you may get well again . ” But the wound was so slight that the Roe , next morning , did not feel it any more .
And when he again heard the sport outside , he said , “ I cannot bear it , I must be there .
They shall not find it so easy to catch me ! ” The little sister cried , and said , “ This time they will kill you , and here am I alone in the forest , and forsaken by all the world .
I will not let you out . ” “ Then you will have me die of grief , ” answered the Roe .
“ When I hear the bugle-horns I feel as if I must jump out of my skin . ” Then the little sister could not do otherwise , but opened the door for him with a heavy heart , and the Roe , full of health and joy , bounded away into the forest .
When the King saw him , he said to his huntsman , “ Now chase him all day long till nightfall , but take care that no one does him any harm . ” As soon as the sun had set , the King said to the huntsmen , “ Now come and show me the cottage in the wood ; ” and when he was at the door , he knocked and called out , “ Dear little Sister , let me in . ” Then the door opened , and the King walked in , and there stood a maiden more lovely than any he had ever seen .
The maiden was frightened when she saw , not her little Roe , but a man with a golden crown upon his head .
But the King looked kindly at her , stretched out his hand , and said : “ Will you go with me to my palace and be my dear wife ? ” &#91; Illustration : THE KING SAID , “ WILL YOU BE MY DEAR WIFE ? ” &#93; “ Yes , indeed , ” answered the maiden , “ but the little Roe must go with me .
I cannot leave him . ” The King said , “ He shall stay with you as long as you live , and shall want nothing . ” Just then he came running in , and the little sister again tied him with the cord of rushes , took it in her own hand , and went away with the King from the cottage .
The King took the lovely maiden upon his horse and carried her to his palace , where the wedding was held with great pomp .
She was now the Queen , and they lived for a long time happily together .
The Roe was tended and cherished , and ran about in the palace-garden .
But the wicked Witch , because of whom the children had gone out into the world , thought all the time that the little sister had been torn to pieces by the wild beasts in the wood , and that the little brother had been shot for a Roe by the huntsmen .
Now when she heard that they were so happy , and so well off , envy and hatred rose in her heart and left her no peace , and she thought of nothing but how she could bring them again to misfortune .
Her own daughter , who was as ugly as night , and had only one eye , grumbled at her and said , “ A Queen !
that ought to have been my luck . ” “ Only be quiet , ” answered the old woman , and comforted her by saying , “ when the time comes I shall be ready . ” As time went on , the Queen had a pretty little boy .
It happened that the King was out hunting ; so the old Witch took the form of the chambermaid , went into the room where the Queen lay , and said to her , “ Come , the bath is ready .
It will do you good , and give you fresh strength .
Make haste before it gets cold . ” The daughter also was close by ; so they carried the weak Queen into the bathroom , and put her into the bath .
Then they shut the door and ran away .
But in the bathroom they had made a fire of such deadly heat , that the beautiful young Queen was soon suffocated .
When this was done , the old woman took her daughter , put a nightcap on her head , and laid her in bed in place of the Queen .
She gave her too the shape and the look of the Queen , only she could not make good the lost eye .
But , in order that the King might not see it , she was to lie on the side on which she had no eye .
In the evening , when he came home and heard that he had a son , he was heartily glad , and was going to the bed of his dear wife to see how she was .
But the old woman quickly called out , “ For your life leave the curtains closed .
The Queen ought not to see the light yet , and must have rest . ” The King went away , and did not find out that a false Queen was lying in the bed .
But at midnight , when all slept , the nurse , who was sitting in the nursery by the cradle , and who was the only person awake , saw the door open and the true Queen walk in .
She took the child out of the cradle , laid it on her arm and nursed it .
Then she shook up its pillow , laid the child down again , and covered it with the little quilt .
And she did not forget the Roe , but went into the corner where he lay , and stroked his back .
Then she went quite silently out of the door again .
The next morning , the nurse asked the guards whether any one had come into the palace during the night , but they answered , “ No , we have seen no one . ” She came thus many nights and never spoke a word .
The nurse always saw her , but she did not dare to tell any one about it .
When some time had passed in this manner , the Queen began to speak in the night , and said : “ _ How fares my child , how fares my Roe ?
Twice shall I come , then never moe ! _ ” The nurse did not answer , but when the Queen had gone again , went to the King and told him all .
The King said , “ Ah , heavens !
what is this ?
To-morrow night I will watch by the child . ” In the evening he went into the nursery , and at midnight the Queen again appeared , and said : “ _ How fares my child , how fares my Roe ?
Once shall I come , then never moe ! _ ” And she nursed the child as she was wont to do before she disappeared .
The King dared not speak to her , but on the next night he watched again .
Then she said : “ _ How fares my child , How fares my Roe ?
This time I come , then never moe ! _ ” At that the King could not restrain himself .
He sprang toward her , and said , “ You can be none other than my dear wife . ” She answered , “ Yes , I am your dear wife , ” and at the same moment she received life again , and by God ’ s grace became fresh , rosy , and full of health .
Then she told the King the evil deed which the wicked Witch and her daughter had been guilty of toward her .
The King ordered both to be led before the judge , and judgment was delivered against them .
The daughter was taken into the forest where she was torn to pieces by wild beasts , but the Witch was cast into the fire and miserably burnt .
And as soon as she was burnt the Roe changed his shape , and received his human form again .
So the little sister and little brother lived happily together all their lives .
&#91; Illustration &#93; THE STAR-MONEY There was once on a time , a little girl whose father and mother were dead .
She was so poor that she no longer had any little room to live in , or bed to sleep in .
At last , she had nothing else but the clothes she was wearing and a little bit of bread in her hand which some charitable soul had given her .
She was , however , good and pious .
And as she was thus forsaken by all the world , she went forth into the open country , trusting in the good God .
Then a poor man met her , who said , “ Ah , give me something to eat , I am so hungry ! ” She reached him the whole of her piece of bread , and said , “ May God bless it to your use , ” and went onward .
Then came a child who moaned and said , “ My head is so cold , give me something to cover it with . ” So she took off her hood and gave it to him .
And when she had walked a little farther , she met another child who had no jacket and was frozen with cold .
Then she gave it her own .
A little farther on one begged for a frock , and she gave away that also .
At length , she got into a forest and it had already become dark , and there came yet another child , and asked for a little shirt .
The good little girl thought to herself , “ It is a dark night and no one sees me .
I can very well give my little shirt away , ” and took it off , and gave away that also .
And she so stood , and had not one single thing left .
Then suddenly some Stars from heaven fell down , and they were nothing else but hard smooth pieces of money !
And although she had just given her little shirt away , lo !
she had a new one which was of the very finest linen .
Then she gathered together the money into this , and was rich all the days of her life .
&#91; Illustration &#93; THE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE There was once on a time , a Fisherman who lived with his wife in a miserable hovel close by the sea , and every day he went out fishing .
And once , as he was sitting with his rod , looking at the clear water , his line suddenly went down , far down below , and when he drew it up again , he brought out a large Flounder .
Then the Flounder said to him : “ Hark , you Fisherman , I pray you , let me live .
I am no Flounder really , but an enchanted Prince .
What good will it do you to kill me ?
I should not be good to eat .
Put me in the water again , and let me go . ” “ Come , ” said the Fisherman , “ there is no need for so many words about it--a fish that can talk I should certainly let go , anyhow . ” With that he put him back again into the clear water , and the Flounder went to the bottom , leaving a long streak of blood behind him .
Then the Fisherman got up and went home to his wife in the hovel .
“ Husband , ” said the woman , “ have you caught nothing to-day ? ” “ No , ” said the man , “ I did catch a Flounder , who said he was an enchanted Prince , so I let him go again . ” “ Did you not wish for anything first ? ” said the woman .
“ No , ” said the man ; “ what should I wish for ? ” “ Ah , ” said the woman , “ it is surely hard to have to live always in this dirty hovel .
You might have wished for a small cottage for us .
Go back and call him .
Tell him we want to have a small cottage .
He will certainly give us that . ” “ Ah , ” said the man , “ why should I go there again ? ” “ Why , ” said the woman , “ you did catch him , and you let him go again .
He is sure to do it .
Go at once . ” The man still did not quite like to go , but did not want to oppose his wife , and went to the sea .
When he got there the sea was all green and yellow , and no longer smooth .
So he stood and said : “ _ Flounder , Flounder in the sea , Come , I pray thee , here to me ; For my wife , Dame Ilsabil , Wills not as I ’ d have her will . _ ” Then the Flounder came swimming to him and said , “ Well , what does she want , then ? ” “ Ah , ” said the man , “ I did catch you , and my wife says I really ought to have wished for something .
She does not like to live in a wretched hovel any longer .
She would like to have a cottage . ” “ Go , then , ” said the Flounder , “ she has it already . ” When the man got home , his wife was no longer in the hovel .
But instead of it , there stood a small cottage , and she was sitting on a bench before the door .
Then she took him by the hand and said to him , “ Just come inside , look .
Now isn ’ t this a great deal better ? ” So they went in , and there was a small porch , and a pretty little parlor and bedroom , and a kitchen and pantry , with the best of furniture , and fitted up with the most beautiful things made of tin and brass , whatsoever was wanted .
And behind the cottage , there was a small yard , with hens and ducks , and a little garden with flowers and fruit .
“ Look , ” said the wife , “ is not that nice ! ” “ Yes , ” said the husband , “ and so we must always think it , --now we will live quite contented . ” “ We will think about that , ” said the wife .
With that they ate something and went to bed .
Everything went well for a week or a fortnight , and then the woman said , “ Hark you , Husband , this cottage is far too small for us , and the garden and yard are little .
The Flounder might just as well have given us a larger house .
I should like to live in a great stone castle .
Go to the Flounder , and tell him to give us a castle . ” “ Ah , Wife , ” said the man , “ the cottage is quite good enough .
Why should we live in a castle ? ” “ What ! ” said the woman ; “ go at once , the Flounder can always do that . ” “ No , Wife , ” said the man , “ the Flounder has just given us the cottage .
I do not like to go back so soon , it might make him angry . ” “ Go , ” said the woman , “ he can do it quite easily , and will be glad to do it .
Just you go to him . ” The man ’ s heart grew heavy , and he did not wish to go .
He said to himself , “ It is not right , ” and yet he went .
And when he came to the sea , the water was quite purple and dark-blue , and gray and thick , and no longer green and yellow , but it was still quiet .
And he stood there and said : “ _ Flounder , Flounder in the sea , Come , I pray thee , here to me ; For my wife , Dame Ilsabil , Wills not as I ’ d have her will . _ ” “ Well , what does she want , now ? ” said the Flounder .
“ Alas , ” said the man , half scared , “ she wants to live in a great stone castle . ” “ Go to it , then , she is standing before the door , ” said the Flounder .
Then the man went home , and when he got there , he found a great stone palace , and his wife was just standing on the steps going in .
She took him by the hand and said , “ Come in . ” So he went with her , and in the castle was a great hall paved with marble , and many servants , who flung wide the doors .
The walls were all bright with beautiful hangings , and in the rooms were chairs and tables of pure gold .
Crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling , and all the rooms and bedrooms had carpets .
Food and wine of the very best were standing on all the tables , so that they nearly broke down beneath it .
Behind the house , too , there was a great courtyard , with stables for horses and cows , and the very best of carriages .
There was a magnificent large garden , too , with the most beautiful flowers and fruit-trees , and a park quite half a mile long , in which were stags , deer , and hares , and everything that could be desired .
“ Come , ” said the woman , “ isn ’ t that beautiful ? ” “ Yes , indeed , ” said the man , “ now let it be ; and we will live in this beautiful castle and be content . ” “ We will consider about that , ” said the woman , “ and sleep upon it ; ” thereupon they went to bed .
Next morning , the wife awoke first .
It was just daybreak , and from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying before her .
Her husband was still stretching himself , so she poked him in the side with her elbow , and said , “ Get up , Husband , and just peep out of the window .
Look you , couldn ’ t we be the King over all that land ?
Go to the Flounder , we will be the King . ” “ Ah , Wife , ” said the man , “ why should we be King ?
I do not want to be King . ” “ Well , ” said the wife , “ if you won ’ t be King , I will .
Go to the Flounder , for I will be King . ” “ Ah , Wife , ” said the man , “ why do you want to be King ?
I do not like to say that to him . ” “ Why not ? ” said the woman ; “ go to him at once .
I must be King ! ” So the man went , and was quite unhappy because his wife wished to be King .
“ It is not right ; it is not right , ” thought he .
He did not wish to go , but yet he went .
And when he came to the sea , it was quite dark-gray , and the water heaved up from below , and smelt putrid .
Then he went and stood by it , and said : “ _ Flounder , Flounder in the sea , Come , I pray thee , here to me ; For my wife , Dame Ilsabil , Wills not as I ’ d have her will . _ ” “ Well , what does she want , now ? ” said the Flounder .
“ Alas , ” said the man , “ she wants to be King . ” “ Go to her ; she is King already . ” So the man went , and when he came to the palace , the castle had become much larger , and had a great tower and magnificent ornaments .
The sentinel was standing before the door , and there were numbers of soldiers with kettledrums and trumpets .
And when he went inside the house , everything was of real marble and gold , with velvet covers and great golden tassels .
Then the doors of the hall were opened , and there was the Court in all its splendor , and his wife was sitting on a high throne of gold and diamonds , with a great crown of gold on her head , and a sceptre of pure gold and jewels in her hand .
On both sides of her , stood her maids-in-waiting in a row , each of them always one head shorter than the last .
Then he went and stood before her , and said , “ Ah , Wife , and now you are King . ” “ Yes , ” said the woman , “ now I am King . ” So he stood and looked at her , and when he had looked at her thus for some time , he said , “ And now that you are King , let all else be , we will wish for nothing more . ” “ Nay , Husband , ” said the woman , quite anxiously , “ I find time pass very heavily , I can bear it no longer .
Go to the Flounder--I am King , but I must be Emperor , too . ” “ Alas , Wife , why do you wish to be Emperor ? ” “ Husband , ” said she , “ go to the Flounder .
I will be Emperor . ” “ Alas , Wife , ” said the man , “ he cannot make you Emperor .
I may not say that to the fish .
There is only one Emperor in the land .
An Emperor , the Flounder cannot make you !
I assure you he cannot . ” “ What ! ” said the woman , “ I am the King , and you are nothing but my husband .
Will you go this moment ?
go at once !
If he can make a King , he can make an Emperor .
I will be Emperor .
Go instantly . ” So he was forced to go .
As the man went , however , he was troubled in mind , and thought to himself , “ It will not end well !
It will not end well !
Emperor is too shameless !
The Flounder will at last be tired out . ” With that , he reached the sea , and the sea was quite black and thick , and began to boil up from below , so that it threw up bubbles .
And such a sharp wind blew over it that it curdled , and the man was afraid .
Then he went and stood by it , and said : “ _ Flounder , Flounder in the sea , Come , I pray thee , here to me ; For my wife , Dame Ilsabil , Wills not as I ’ d have her will . _ ” “ Well , what does she want , now ? ” said the Flounder .
“ Alas , Flounder , ” said he , “ my wife wants to be Emperor . ” “ Go to her , ” said the Flounder ; “ she is Emperor already . ” So the man went , and when he got there the whole palace was made of polished marble with alabaster figures and golden ornaments .
And soldiers were marching before the door blowing trumpets , and beating cymbals and drums .
In the house , barons , and counts , and dukes were going about as servants .
Then they opened the doors to him , which were of pure gold .
And when he entered , there sat his wife on a throne , which was made of one piece of gold , and was quite two miles high ; and she wore a great golden crown that was three yards high , and set with diamonds and carbuncles .
In one hand she had the sceptre , and in the other the imperial orb .
And on both sides of her stood the yeomen of the guard in two rows , each being smaller than the one before him , from the biggest Giant , who was two miles high , to the very smallest Dwarf , just as big as my little finger .
And before it stood a number of princes and dukes .
Then the man went and stood among than , and said , “ Wife , are you Emperor now ? ” “ Yes , ” said she , “ now I am Emperor . ” Then he stood and looked at her well , and when he had looked at her thus for some time , he said , “ Ah , Wife , be content , now that you are Emperor . ” “ Husband , ” said she , “ why are you standing there ?
Now , I am Emperor , but I will be Pope too .
Go to the Flounder . ” “ Alas , Wife , ” said the man , “ what will you not wish for ?
You cannot be Pope .
There is but one in Christendom .
He cannot make you Pope . ” “ Husband , ” said she , “ I will be Pope .
Go immediately .
I must be Pope this very day . ” &#91; Illustration : “ YES , ” SAID SHE “ NOW I AM EMPEROR ” &#93; “ No , Wife , ” said the man , “ I do not like to say that to him ; that would not do , it is too much .
The Flounder can ’ t make you Pope . ” “ Husband , ” said she , “ what nonsense !
if he can make an Emperor he can make a Pope .
Go to him directly .
I am Emperor , and you are nothing but my husband .
Will you go at once ? ” Then he was afraid and went .
But he was quite faint , and shivered and shook , and his knees and legs trembled .
And a high wind blew over the land , and the clouds flew , and toward evening all grew dark , and the leaves fell from the trees , and the water rose and roared as if it were boiling , and splashed upon the shore .
In the distance he saw ships which were firing guns in their sore need , pitching and tossing on the waves .
And yet in the midst of the sky , there was still a small bit of blue , though on every side it was as red as in a heavy storm .
So , full of despair , he went and stood in much fear , and said : “ _ Flounder , Flounder in the sea , Come , I pray thee , here to me ; For my wife , Dame Ilsabil , Wills not as I ’ d have her will . _ ” “ Well , what does she want , now ? ” said the Flounder .
“ Alas , ” said the man , “ she wants to be Pope . ” “ Go to her then , ” said the Flounder ; “ she is Pope already . ” &lt; p &gt; So he went , and when he got there , he saw what seemed to be a large church surrounded by palaces .
He pushed his way through the crowd .
Inside , however , everything was lighted with thousands and thousands of candles , and his wife was clad in gold , and she was sitting on a much higher throne , and had three great golden crowns on , and round about her there was much churchly splendor .
And on both sides of her was a row of candles , the largest of which was as tall as the very tallest tower , down to the very smallest kitchen candle ; and all the emperors and kings were on their knees before her , kissing her shoe .
“ Wife , ” said the man , and looked attentively at her , “ are you now Pope ? ” “ Yes , ” said she , “ I am Pope . ” So he stood and looked at her , and it was just as if he was looking at the bright sun .
When he had stood looking at her thus for a short time , he said , “ Ah , Wife , if you are Pope , do let well alone ! ” But she looked as stiff as a post , and did not move or show any signs of life .
Then said he , “ Wife , now that you are Pope , be satisfied , you cannot become anything greater . ” “ I will consider about that , ” said the woman .
Thereupon they both went to bed .
But she was not satisfied , and greediness let her have no sleep , for she was continually thinking what there was left for her to be .
The man slept well and soundly , for he had run about a great deal during the day .
But the woman could not fall asleep at all , and flung herself from one side to the other the whole night through , thinking what more was left for her to be , but unable to call to mind anything else .
At length the sun began to rise , and when the woman saw the red of dawn , she sat up in bed and looked at it .
And when , through the window , she saw the sun thus rising , she said , “ Cannot I , too , order the sun and moon to rise ? ” “ Husband , ” said she , poking him in the ribs with her elbows , “ wake up !
go to the Flounder , for I wish to be even as God is . ” The man was still half asleep , but he was so horrified that he fell out of bed .
He thought he must have heard amiss , and rubbed his eyes , and said , “ Alas , Wife , what are you saying ? ” “ Husband , ” said she , “ if I can ’ t order the sun and moon to rise , and have to look on and see the sun and moon rising , I can ’ t bear it .
I shall not know what it is to have another happy hour , unless I can make them rise myself . ” Then she looked at him so terribly that a shudder ran over him , and said , “ Go at once .
I wish to be like unto God . ” “ Alas , Wife , ” said the man , falling on his knees before her , “ the Flounder cannot do that .
He can make an Emperor and a Pope .
I beseech you , go on as you are , and be Pope . ” Then she fell into a rage , and her hair flew wildly about her head , and she cried , “ I will not endure this , I ’ ll not bear it any longer .
Will you go ? ” Then he put on his trousers and ran away like a madman .
But outside a great storm was raging , and blowing so hard that he could scarcely keep his feet .
Houses and trees toppled over , mountains trembled , rocks rolled into the sea , the sky was pitch black , and it thundered and lightened .
And the sea came in with black waves as high as church-towers and mountains , and all with crests of white foam at the top .
Then he cried , but could not hear his own words : “ _ Flounder , Flounder in the sea , Come , I pray thee , here to me ; For my wife , Dame Ilsabil , Wills not as I ’ d have her will . _ ” “ Well ; what does she want , now ? ” said the Flounder .
“ Alas , ” said he , “ she wants to be like unto God . ” “ Go to her , and you will find her back again in the dirty hovel . ” And there they are living at this very time .
&#91; Illustration &#93; THE WHITE SNAKE A long time ago , there lived a King who was famed for his wisdom through all the land .
Nothing was hidden from him , and it seemed as if news of the most secret things was brought to him through the air .
But he had a strange custom .
Every day after dinner , when the table was cleared , and no one else was present , a trusty servant had to bring him one more dish .
