It was covered and even the servant did not know what was in it .
Neither did any one know , for the King never took off the cover to eat of it , until he was quite alone .
This had gone on for a long time , when one day the servant , who took away the dish , was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help carrying the dish into his room .
When he had carefully locked the door , he lifted up the cover , and saw a White Snake lying on the dish .
But when he saw it , he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it , so he cut off a little bit and put it into his mouth .
No sooner had it touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices outside his window .
He went and listened , and then noticed that it was the sparrows who were chattering together , and telling one another of all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods .
Eating the Snake had given him power to understand the language of animals !
Now , it so happened , that on this very day the Queen lost her most beautiful ring , and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty servant , who was allowed to go everywhere .
The King ordered the man to be brought before him , and threatened with angry words that unless he could , before the morrow , point out the thief , he himself should be looked upon as guilty and should be executed .
In vain , he declared his innocence .
He was dismissed with no better answer .
In his trouble and fear , he went down into the courtyard , and took thought how to help himself out of his trouble .
Now some ducks were sitting together quietly by a brook and taking their rest .
And , whilst they were making their feathers smooth with their bills , they were having a confidential conversation .
The servant stood by and listened .
They were telling one another of all the places where they had been waddling about all the morning , and what good food they had found .
And one said in a pitiful tone , “ Something lies heavy on my stomach ; as I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the Queen ’ s window . ” The servant at once seized her by the neck , carried her to the kitchen , and said to the cook , “ Here is a fine duck .
Pray kill her . ” “ Yes , ” said the cook , and weighed her in his hand ; “ she has spared no trouble to fatten herself , and has been waiting long enough to be roasted . ” So he cut off her head ; and as she was being dressed for the spit , the Queen ’ s ring was found inside her .
The servant could now easily prove his innocence .
The King , to make amends for the wrong , allowed him to ask a favor , and promised him the best place in the Court .
The servant refused everything , and asked only for a horse and some money for traveling , as he had a mind to see the world and go about a little .
When his request was granted , he set out on his way .
One day he came to a pond , where he saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water .
Now , though it is said that fishes are dumb , he heard them lamenting that they must perish so miserably .
As he had a kind heart , he got off his horse and put the three prisoners back into the water .
They quivered with delight , put out their heads , and cried to him , “ We will remember you , and repay you for saving us ! ” He rode on , and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in the sand at his feet .
He listened , and heard an Ant-King complain , “ Why cannot folk , with their clumsy beasts , keep off our bodies ?
That stupid horse , with his heavy hoofs , has been treading down my people without mercy ! ” So he turned on to a side path and the Ant-King cried out to him , “ We will remember you---one good turn deserves another ! ” The path led him into a wood , and there he saw two old ravens standing by their nest , and throwing out their young ones .
“ Out with you , you idle , good-for-nothing creatures ! ” cried they ; “ we cannot find food for you any longer .
You are big enough , and can provide for yourselves . ” But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground flapping their wings , and crying , “ Oh , what helpless chicks we are !
We must shift for ourselves , and yet we cannot fly !
What can we do , but lie here and starve ? ” So the good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword , and gave it to them for food .
Then they came hopping up to it , satisfied their hunger , and cried , “ We will remember you--one good turn deserves another ! ” And now he had to use his own legs , and when he had walked a long way , he came to a large city .
There was a great noise and crowd in the streets , and a man rode up on horseback , crying aloud , “ The King ’ s Daughter wants a husband .
But whoever sues for her hand must perform a hard task .
If he does not succeed he will forfeit his life . ” Many had already made the attempt , but in vain .
Nevertheless , when the youth saw the King ’ s Daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty , that he forgot all danger , went before the King , and declared himself a suitor .
So he was led out to the sea , and a gold ring was cast into it .
Then the King ordered him to fetch this ring up from the bottom of the sea , and added , “ If you come up without it , you will be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves . ” All the people grieved for the handsome youth ; then they went away ; leaving him alone by the sea .
&#91; Illustration : THERE LAY THE GOLD RING IN THE SHELL &#93; He stood on the shore and considered what he should do , when suddenly he saw three fishes come swimming toward him .
They were the very fishes whose lives he had saved .
The one in the middle held a mussel in its mouth , which it laid on the shore at the youth ’ s feet .
When he had taken it up and opened it , there lay the gold ring in the shell .
Full of joy he took it to the King , and expected that he would grant him the promised reward .
But when the proud Princess perceived that he was not her equal in birth , she scorned him , and required him first to perform another task .
She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten sacksful of millet-seed on the grass .
Then she said , “ To-morrow morning before sunrise these must be picked up , and not a single grain be wanting . ” The youth sat down in the garden and considered how he might perform this task .
But he could think of nothing , and there he sat sorrowfully awaiting the break of day , when he should be led to death .
But as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden , he saw all the ten sacks standing side by side , quite full , and not a single grain was missing .
The Ant-King had come in the night with thousands and thousands of ants , and the grateful creatures had , by great industry , picked up all the millet-seeds and gathered them into the sacks .
Presently , the King ’ s Daughter herself came down into the garden , and was amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him .
But she could not yet conquer her proud heart , and said , “ Although he has performed both the tasks , he shall not be my husband , until he has brought me an apple from the Tree of Life . ” The youth did not know where the Tree of Life stood , but he set out , and would have gone on forever , as long as his legs would carry him , though he had no hope of finding it .
After he had wandered through three kingdoms , he came one evening to a wood , and lay down under a tree to sleep .
But he heard a rustling in the branches , and a Golden Apple fell into his hand .
At the same time three ravens flew down to him , perched themselves upon his knee , and said , “ We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving .
When we had grown big , and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple , we flew over the sea to the end of the world , where the Tree of Life stands , and have brought you the apple . ” The youth , full of joy , set out homeward , and took the Golden Apple to the King ’ s beautiful Daughter , who had now no more excuses left to make .
They cut the Apple of Life in two and ate it together ; and then her heart became full of love for him , and they lived to a great age in undisturbed happiness .
&#91; Illustration &#93; HAENSEL AND GRETHEL Hard by a great forest , dwelt a poor woodcutter with his wife and his two children .
The boy was called Haensel and the girl , Grethel .
He had little to bite and to break ; and once when great scarcity fell on the land , he could no longer procure daily bread .
Now , when he thought over this by night in his bed , and tossed about in his anxiety , he groaned and said to his wife , “ What is to become of us ?
How are we to feed our poor children , when we no longer have anything even for ourselves ? ” “ I ’ ll tell you what , Husband , ” answered the woman , “ early to-morrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where it is the thickest ; there we will light a fire for them , and give each of them one piece of bread more .
Then we will go to our work and leave them alone .
They will not find the way home again , and we shall be rid of them . ” “ No , Wife , ” said the man , “ I will not do that .
How can I bear to leave my children alone in the forest ? --the wild animals would soon come and tear them to pieces . ” “ Oh , you fool ! ” said she .
“ Then we must all four die of hunger .
You may as well plane the planks for our coffins . ” And she left him no peace until he consented .
“ But I feel very sorry for the poor children , all the same , ” said the man .
The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger , and had heard what the woman had said to their father .
Grethel wept bitter tears , and said to Haensel , “ Now all is over with us . ” “ Be quiet , Grethel , ” said Haensel , “ do not distress yourself , I will soon find a way to help us . ” And when the old folk had fallen asleep , he got up , put on his little coat , opened the door below , and crept outside .
The moon shone brightly , and the white pebbles , which lay in front of the house , glittered like real silver pennies .
Haensel stooped and put as many of them in the little pocket of his coat as he could possibly get in .
Then he went back and said to Grethel , “ Be comforted , dear little Sister , and sleep in peace .
God will not forsake us , ” and he lay down again in his bed .
When day dawned , but before the sun had risen , the woman came and awoke the two children , saying , “ Get up , you sluggards !
we are going into the forest to fetch wood . ” She gave each a little piece of bread , and said , “ There is something for your dinner , but do not eat it up before then , for you will get nothing else . ” Grethel took the bread under her apron , as Haensel had the stones in his pocket .
Then they all set out together on the way to the forest .
When they had walked a short time , Haensel stood still and peeped back , and did so again and again while he was throwing the white pebble-stones one by one out of his pocket onto the road .
When they had reached the middle of the forest , the father said , “ Now , Children , pile up some wood , and I will light a fire that you may not be cold . ” Haensel and Grethel gathered brushwood together , as high as a little hill .
The brushwood was lighted , and when the flames were burning very high , the woman said , “ Now , Children , lay yourselves down by the fire and rest .
We will go into the forest and cut some wood .
When we have done , we will come back and fetch you away . ” Haensel and Grethel sat by the fire , and when noon came , each ate a little piece of bread ; and , as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe , they believed that their father was near .
It was , however , not the axe , it was a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was blowing backward and forward .
And as they had been sitting such a long time , their eyes shut with fatigue , and they fell fast asleep .
When at last they awoke , it was already dark night .
Grethel began to cry and said , “ How are we to get out of the forest now ? ” But Haensel comforted her , and said , “ Just wait a little , until the moon has risen , and then we shall soon find the way . ” And when the full moon had risen , Haensel took his little sister by the hand , and followed the pebbles which shone like newly-coined silver pieces , and showed them the way .
They walked the whole night long , and , by break of day , came once more to their father ’ s house .
They knocked at the door ; and when the woman opened it and saw that it was Haensel and Grethel , she said , “ You naughty children , why have you slept so long in the forest ? --we thought you were never coming back at all ! ” The father , however , rejoiced , for it had cut him to the heart to leave them behind alone .
Not long afterward , there was another famine in all parts , and the children heard their mother saying at night to their father , “ Everything is eaten again , we have one-half loaf left , and after that there is an end .
The children must go , we will take them farther into the wood , so that they will not find their way out again .
There is no other means of saving ourselves ! ” The man ’ s heart was heavy , and he thought “ it would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your children ! ” The woman , however , would listen to nothing that he had to say , but scolded and reproached him .
He who says A must say B , likewise , and as he had yielded the first time , he had to do so a second time also .
The children were , however , still awake and had heard the conversation .
When the old folk were asleep , Haensel again got up to go out and pick up pebbles .
But the woman had locked the door , and Haensel could not get out .
Nevertheless he comforted his little sister , and said , “ Do not cry , Grethel , go to sleep quietly , the good God will help us . ” Early in the morning , came the woman , and took the children out of their beds .
Their bit of bread was given to them , but it was still smaller than the time before .
On the way into the forest , Haensel crumbled his in his pocket , and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground , and little by little , threw all the crumbs on the path .
The woman led the children still deeper into the forest , where they had never in their lives been before .
Then a great fire was again made , and the mother said , “ Just sit there , you Children , and when you are tired you may sleep a little .
We are going into the forest to cut wood .
In the evening , when we are done , we will come and fetch you away . ” When it was noon , Grethel shared her piece of bread with Haensel , who had scattered his by the way .
Then they fell asleep , and evening passed , but no one came to the poor children .
They did not awake until it was dark night , and Haensel comforted his little sister and said , “ Just wait , Grethel , until the moon rises , and then we shall see the crumbs of bread which I have strewn .
They will show us our way home again . ” When the moon came , they set out , but they found no crumbs , for the many thousands of birds , which fly about in the woods and fields , had picked them all up .
Haensel said to Grethel , “ We shall soon find the way , ” but they did not find it .
They walked the whole night and all the next day , from morning till evening , but they did not get out of the forest , and were very hungry , for they had nothing to eat but two or three berries , which grew on the ground .
And as they were so weary that their legs would carry them no longer , they lay down beneath a tree and fell asleep .
It was now three mornings since they had left their father ’ s house .
They began to walk again , but they always got deeper into the forest .
If help did not come soon , they must die of hunger and weariness !
When it was midday , they saw a beautiful Snow-White Bird sitting on a bough , which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it .
And when it had finished its song , it spread its wings and flew away before them .
They followed it until they reached a little house , on the roof of which it alighted .
When they came quite up to the little House they saw that it was built of bread and covered with cakes , but that the windows were of clear sugar .
“ We will set to work on that , ” said Haensel , “ and have a good meal .
I will eat a bit of the roof , and you , Grethel , can eat some of the window ; it will taste sweet . ” Haensel reached up and broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted .
Grethel leant against the window and nibbled at the panes .
Then a soft voice cried from the room : “ _ Nibble , nibble , gnaw !
Who nibbles at my door ? _ ” but the children went on eating without disturbing themselves .
Haensel , who thought the roof tasted very nice , tore down a great piece of it .
Grethel pushed out the whole of one round window-pane , sat down , and enjoyed herself with it .
Suddenly the door opened , and a very , very old woman , leaning on crutches , came creeping out .
Haensel and Grethel were so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their hands .
The Old Woman , however , nodded her head , and said , “ Oh , you dear Children , who has brought you here ?
Do come in , and stay with me .
No harm shall happen to you . ” She took them both by the hand , and led them into her little house .
Then she set good food before them , milk and pancakes , with sugar , apples , and nuts .
Afterward she covered two pretty little beds with clean white linen , and Haensel and Grethel lay down in them , and thought they were in Heaven .
The Old Woman had only pretended to be so kind .
She was really a wicked Witch , who lay in wait for children , and who had built the little bread house in order to entice them there .
When a child fell into her power , she killed it , cooked , and ate it ; and that was a feast-day with her .
Witches have red eyes , and cannot see far , but they have a keen scent like the beasts ’ , and are aware when human beings draw near .
When Haensel and Grethel came into her neighborhood , she laughed maliciously , and said mockingly , “ I have them , they shall not escape me again ! ” Early in the morning before the children were awake , she was up .
And when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so pretty , with their plump red cheeks , she muttered to herself , “ That will be a dainty mouthful ! ” Then she seized Haensel with her shrivelled hand , carried him into a little stable , and shut him in with a grated door .
He might scream as he liked , that was of no use !
Then she went to Grethel , shook her till she awoke , and cried , “ Get up , lazy thing , fetch some water , and cook something good for your brother .
He is in the stable outside , and is to be made fat .
When he is fat , I will eat him . ” Grethel began to weep bitterly .
But it was all in vain , she was forced to do what the wicked Witch ordered her .
And now the best food was cooked for poor Haensel , while Grethel got nothing but crab-shells .
Every morning the woman crept to the little stable , and cried , “ Haensel , stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon be fat . ” When four weeks had gone by she was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer .
“ Ho , there !
Grethel , ” she cried to the girl , “ be active , and bring some water .
Let Haensel be fat or lean , to-morrow I will kill him , and cook him . ” Ah !
how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water , and how her tears did flow down over her cheeks !
“ Dear God , do help us , ” she cried .
“ If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us , we should at any rate have died together ! ” “ Just keep your noise to yourself , ” said the Old Woman , “ all that won ’ t help you at all . ” Early in the morning , Grethel had to go out and hang up the cauldron , full of water , and light the fire .
“ We will bake first , ” said the Old Woman , “ I have already heated the oven , and kneaded the dough . ” She pushed poor Grethel out to the oven , from which flames of fire were darting .
“ Creep in , ” said the Witch , “ and see if it is properly heated , so that we can shut the bread in . ” And when once Grethel was inside , she intended to shut the oven and let her bake in it , and then eat her , too .
But Grethel saw what she had in her mind , and would not creep in .
“ Silly Goose , ” said the Old Woman ; “ the door is big enough .
Just look , I can get in myself ! ” and she crept up and thrust her head in .
Then she fell over into the oven and was miserably burnt to death .
Grethel , however , ran as quick as lightning to Haensel , opened his little stable , and cried , “ Haensel , we are saved !
The old Witch is dead ! ” Then Haensel sprang out like a bird from its cage , when the door is opened for it .
How they did rejoice and embrace each other , and dance about and kiss each other !
And as they had no longer any need to fear her , they went into the Witch ’ s house , and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels .
“ These are far better than pebbles ! ” said Haensel , and thrust into his pockets whatever could be got in .
And Grethel said , “ I , too , will take something home with me , ” and filled her pinafore full .
“ But now we will go away , ” said Haensel , “ that we may get out of the Witch ’ s forest . ” When they had walked for two hours , they came to a great piece of water .
“ We cannot get over , ” said Haensel , “ I see no foot-plank , and no bridge . ” “ And no boat crosses either , ” answered Grethel , “ but a white duck is swimming there .
If I ask her , she will help us over . ” Then she cried : “ _ Little Duck , little Duck , dost thou see , Haensel and Grethel are waiting for thee ?
There ’ s never a plank , nor a bridge in sight , Take us across on thy back so white . _ ” The duck came to them , and Haensel seated himself on her back , and told his sister to sit by him .
“ No , ” replied Grethel , “ that will be too heavy for the little duck .
She shall take us across , one after the other . ” The good little duck did so , and when they were once safely across and had walked for a short time , the forest seemed to be more and more familiar to them .
At length , they saw from afar their father ’ s house .
Then they began to run , rushed into the parlor , and threw themselves into their father ’ s arms .
The man had not known one happy hour since he had left the children in the forest .
The woman , however , was dead .
Grethel emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the room , and Haensel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to add to them .
Then all trouble was at an end , and they lived together in perfect happiness .
My tale is done , there runs a mouse , whosoever catches it , may make himself a big , big fur cap out of it !
&#91; Illustration &#93; THE SEVEN RAVENS There was once a man who had seven sons , but never a daughter no matter how much he wished for one .
At length , his wife had a child , and it was a daughter .
The joy was great .
But the child was sickly and small , and so weak that it had to be baptized at once .
The father sent one of the boys in a hurry to the spring , to fetch water for the baptism .
The other six boys ran along with him .
And as each strove to be the first to fill the jug , it fell into the spring .
There they stood , and did not know what to do .
None of them dared to go home .
When they did not come back , the father grew impatient , and said , “ They have forgotten all about it in a game of play , the wicked boys ! ” Soon he grew afraid lest the child should die without being baptized , and he cried out in anger , “ I wish the boys were all turned into Ravens ! ” Hardly was the word spoken , before he heard a whirring of wings in the air above his head .
He looked up , and saw seven coal-black Ravens flying high and away .
The parents could not recall the curse .
And though they grieved over the loss of their seven sons , yet they comforted themselves somewhat with their dear little daughter , who soon grew strong and every day more beautiful .
For a long time , she did not know that she had had brothers .
Her parents were careful not to mention them before her .
But one day , she chanced to overhear some people talking about her , and saying , “ that the maiden is certainly beautiful , but really to blame for the misfortune of her seven brothers . ” Then she was much troubled , and went to her father and mother , and asked if it was true that she had had brothers , and what was become of them .
The parents did not dare to keep the secret longer , and said that her birth was only the innocent cause of what had happened to her brothers .
But the maiden laid it daily to heart , and thought that she must deliver her brothers .
She had no peace and rest until she set out secretly , and went forth into the wide world to seek them out , and set them free , let it cost what it might .
She took nothing with her but a little ring belonging to her parents as a keepsake , a loaf of bread against hunger , a little pitcher of water against thirst , and a little chair as a provision against weariness .
And now , she went continually onward , far , far , to the very end of the world .
Then she came to the Sun , but it was too hot and terrible , and devoured little children .
Hastily she ran away , and ran to the Moon , but it was far too cold , and also awful and malicious .
And when it saw the child , it said : “ _ I smell , I smell The flesh of men ! _ ” &#91; Illustration : EACH STAR SAT ON ITS OWN LITTLE CHAIR &#93; On this she ran swiftly away , and came to the Stars , which were kind and good to her , and each of them sat on its own little chair .
But the Morning Star arose , and gave her the drumstick of a chicken , and said , “ If you have not that drumstick you cannot open the Glass Mountain , and in the Glass Mountain are your brothers . ” The maiden took the drumstick , wrapped it carefully in a cloth , and went onward again until she came to the Glass Mountain .
The door was shut , and she thought she would take out the drumstick .
But when she undid the cloth , it was empty , and she had lost the good Star ’ s present .
What was she now to do ?
She wished to rescue her brothers , and had no key to the Glass Mountain .
The good little sister took a knife , cut off one of her little fingers , put it in the door , and succeeded in opening it .
When she had got inside , a little Dwarf came to meet her , who said , “ My Child , what are you looking for ? ” “ I am looking for my brothers , the Seven Ravens , ” she replied .
The Dwarf said , “ The Lord Ravens are not at home , but if you wish to wait here until they come , step in . ” Thereupon the little Dwarf carried the Ravens ’ dinner in , on seven little plates , and in seven little glasses .
The little sister ate a morsel from each plate , and from each little glass she took a sip .
But in the last little glass she dropped the ring which she had brought away with her .
Suddenly , she heard a whirring of wings and a rushing through the air , and then the little Dwarf said , “ Now the Lord Ravens are flying home . ” Then they came , and wanted to eat and drink , and looked for their little plates and glasses .
Then said one after the other , “ Who has eaten something from my plate ?
Who has drunk out of my little glass ?
It was a human mouth . ” And when the seventh came to the bottom of the glass , the ring rolled against his mouth .
Then he looked at it , and saw that it was a ring belonging to his father and mother , and said , “ God grant that our little sister may be here , and then we shall be free . ” When the maiden , who was standing behind the door watching , heard that wish , she came forth , and on this all the Ravens were restored to their human form again .
And they embraced and kissed each other , and went joyfully home .
&#91; Illustration &#93; ASH-MAIDEN The wife of a rich man fell sick , and as she felt that her end was drawing near , she called her only daughter to her bedside and said , “ Dear Child , be good and pious , and then the dear God will always protect you , and I will look down on you from Heaven and be near you . ” Thereupon she closed her eyes and departed .
Every day , the maiden went out to her mother ’ s grave and wept , and she remained pious and good .
When winter came the snow spread a white sheet over the grave , and when the spring-sun had drawn it off again , the man had taken another wife .
The woman had brought two daughters into the house with her , who were beautiful and fair of face , but vile and black of heart .
Now began a bad time for the poor child .
“ Is the stupid goose to sit in the parlor with us ? ” said they .
“ He who wants to eat bread , must earn it .
Out with the kitchen-wench ! ” They took her pretty clothes away from her , put an old gray bedgown on her and gave her wooden shoes .
“ Just look at the proud Princess , how decked out she is ! ” they cried , and laughed , and led her into the kitchen .
There she had to do hard work from morning till night , get up before daybreak , carry water , light fires , cook and wash .
Besides this , the sisters did her every imaginable injury--they mocked her and emptied her peas and lentils into the ashes , so that she was forced to sit and pick them out again .
In the evening , when she had worked till she was weary , she had no bed to go to , but had to sleep by the fireside in the ashes .
And as on that account she always looked dusty and dirty , they called her Ash-Maiden .
It happened once that the father was going to the Fair , and he asked the two daughters what he should bring back for them .
“ Beautiful dresses , ” said one .
“ Pearls and jewels , ” said the second .
“ And you , Ash-Maiden , ” said he , “ what will you have ? ” “ Father , break off for me the first branch which knocks against your hat on your way home . ” So he bought beautiful dresses , pearls and jewels for the two daughters , and on his way home , as he was riding through a green thicket , a hazel twig brushed against him and knocked off his hat .
Then he broke off the branch and took it with him .
When he reached home he gave the two daughters the things which they had wished for , and to Ash-Maiden he gave the branch from the hazel-bush .
Ash-Maiden thanked him , went to her mother ’ s grave and planted the branch on it , and wept so much that the tears fell down on it and watered it .
It grew , however , and became a handsome tree .
Thrice a day Ash-Maiden went and sat beneath it , and wept and prayed , and a little White Bird always came on the tree .
And if Ash-Maiden expressed a wish , the bird threw down to her what she had wished for .
It happened that the King gave a feast , which was to last three days .
To it all the beautiful young girls in the country were invited , in order that his son might choose himself a Bride .
When the two sisters heard that they too were to appear among the number , they were delighted .
They called Ash-Maiden and said , “ Comb our hair , brush our shoes , and fasten our buckles , for we are going to the feast at the King ’ s palace . ” Ash-Maiden obeyed , but wept , because she too would have liked to go with them to the dance , and she begged her mother to allow her to do so .
“ You go , Ash-Maiden ! ” said she ; “ you are dusty and dirty , and would go to the feast ?
You have no clothes and shoes , and yet would dance ! ” As , however , Ash-Maiden went on asking , the mother at last said , “ I have emptied a dish of lentils into the ashes for you .
If you have picked them out again in two hours , you shall go with us . ” The maiden went through the back-door into the garden , and called , “ You tame Pigeons , you Turtledoves , and all you birds beneath the sky , come and help me to pick “ _ The good into the pot , The bad into the crop ! _ ” Then two white pigeons came in by the kitchen-window , and afterward the turtledoves .
And at last all the birds beneath the sky came whirring and crowding in , and alighted amongst the ashes .
And the pigeons nodded with their heads and began _ pick , pick , pick , pick , _ and the rest began also _ pick , pick , pick , pick , _ and gathered all the good grains into the dish .
Hardly had one hour passed before they had finished , and all flew out again .
Then the girl took the dish to the mother , and was glad , and believed that now she would be allowed to go with them to the feast .
But the mother said , “ No , Ash-Maiden , you have no clothes and you cannot dance .
You would only be laughed at . ” And as Ash-Maiden wept at this , the mother said , “ If you can pick two dishes of lentils out of the ashes for me in one hour , you shall go with us . ” And she thought to herself , “ That she most certainly cannot do . ” When the mother had emptied the two dishes of lentils amongst the ashes , the maiden went through the back-door into the garden and cried , “ You tame Pigeons , you Turtledoves , and all you birds under heaven , come and help me to pick “ _ The good into the pot , The bad into the crop ! _ ” Then two white pigeons came in by the kitchen-window , and afterward the turtledoves .
And at last all the birds beneath the sky came whirring and crowding in , and alighted amongst the ashes .
And the doves nodded with their heads and began _ pick , pick , pick , pick , _ and the others began also _ pick , pick , pick , pick , _ and gathered all the good seeds into the dishes .
And before half an hour was over they had already finished , and all flew out again .
Then the maiden carried the dishes to the mother and was delighted , and believed that she might now go with them to the feast .
But the mother said , “ All this will not help you .
You go not with us , for you have no clothes and cannot dance .
We should be ashamed of you ! ” Then she turned her back on Ash-Maiden , and hurried away with her two proud daughters .
As no one was now at home , Ash-Maiden went to her mother ’ s grave beneath the hazel-tree , and cried : “ _ Shiver and quiver , Little Tree , Silver and gold throw over me ! _ ” Then the bird threw a gold and silver dress down to her , and slippers embroidered with silk and silver .
She put on the dress with all speed , and went to the feast .
Her sisters and the mother , however , did not know her , and thought she must be a foreign Princess , for she looked so beautiful in the golden dress .
They never once thought of Ash-Maiden , and believed that she was sitting at home in the dirt , picking lentils out of the ashes .
The Prince went to meet her , took her by the hand , and he danced with her .
He would dance with no other maiden , and never let go of her hand .
And if any one else came to invite her , he said , “ This is my partner . ” She danced till it was evening , and then she wanted to go home .
But the King ’ s Son said , “ I will go with you and bear you company , ” for he wished to see to whom the beautiful maiden belonged .
She escaped from him , however , and sprang into the pigeon-house .
The King ’ s Son waited until her father came , and then he told him that the stranger maiden had leapt into the pigeon-house .
The old man thought , “ Can it be Ash-Maiden ? ” and they had to bring him an axe and a pickaxe that he might hew the pigeon-house to pieces , but no one was inside it .
And when they got home , Ash-Maiden lay in her dirty clothes among the ashes , and a dim little oil-lamp was burning on the mantelpiece .
For Ash-Maiden had jumped quickly down from the back of the pigeon-house , and had run to the little hazel-tree .
There she had taken off her beautiful clothes and laid them on the grave , and the bird had taken them away again .
Then she had placed herself in the kitchen amongst the ashes , in her gray gown .
Next day , when the feast began afresh , and her parents and the sisters had gone once more , Ash-Maiden went to the hazel-tree , and said : “ _ Shiver and quiver , Little Tree , Silver and gold throw over me ! _ ” Then the bird threw down a much more beautiful dress than on the preceding day .
And when Ash-Maiden appeared at the feast in this dress , every one was astonished at her beauty .
The King ’ s Son had waited until she came , and instantly took her by the hand and danced with no one but her .
When others came and invited her , he said , “ She is my partner . ” When evening arrived , she wished to leave , and the King ’ s Son followed her , and wanted to see into which house she went .
But she sprang away from him , and into the garden behind the house .
Therein stood a beautiful tall tree on which hung the most magnificent pears .
She clambered , like a squirrel , so nimbly between the branches , that the King ’ s Son did not know where she was gone .
He waited until her father came , and said to him , “ The stranger-maiden has escaped from me , and I believe she has climbed up the pear-tree . ” The father thought , “ Can it be Ash-Maiden ? ” and had an axe brought and cut the tree down , but no one was on it .
And when they got into the kitchen , Ash-Maiden lay there amongst the ashes , as usual , for she had jumped down on the other side of the tree , had taken the beautiful dress to the bird on the little hazel-tree , and had put on her gray gown .
On the third day , when the parents and sisters had gone away , Ash-Maiden went once more to her mother ’ s grave , and said to the little tree : “ _ Shiver and quiver , Little Tree , Silver and gold throw over me ! _ ” And now the bird threw down to her a dress which was more splendid and magnificent than any she had yet had , and the slippers were golden .
And when she went to the feast in the dress , no one knew how to speak for astonishment .
The King ’ s Son danced with her only , and if any one invited her to dance , he said , “ She is my partner . ” When evening came , Ash-Maiden wished to leave , and the King ’ s Son was anxious to go with her ; but she escaped from him so quickly that he could not follow her .
The King ’ s Son , however , had caused the whole staircase to be smeared with pitch , and there , when she ran down , had the maiden ’ s left slipper remained sticking .
The King ’ s Son picked it up , and it was small and dainty , and all golden .
Next morning , he went with it to the father , and said to him , “ No one shall be my wife , but she whose foot this golden slipper fits . ” Then were the two sisters glad , for they had pretty feet .
The eldest went with the shoe into her room and wanted to try it on , and her mother stood by .
But she could not get her big toe into it , for the shoe was too small for her .
Then her mother gave her a knife , and said , “ Cut the toe off .
When you are Queen you will have no more need to go on foot . ” The maiden cut the toe off , forced the foot into the shoe , swallowed the pain , and went out to the King ’ s Son .
Then he took her on his horse as his Bride , and rode away with her .
They were , however , obliged to pass the grave , and there , on the hazel-tree , sat the two pigeons and cried : “ _ Turn and peep , turn and peep , There ’ s blood within the shoe !
The shoe it is too small for her , The true Bride waits for you ! _ ” Then he looked at her foot , and saw how the blood was streaming from it .
He turned his horse round and took the false Bride home again , and said she was not the true one , and that the other sister was to put the shoe on .
Then this one went into her chamber and got her toes safely into the shoe , but her heel was too large .
So her mother gave her a knife , and said , “ Cut a bit off your heel .
When you are Queen you will have no more need to go on foot . ” The maiden cut a bit off her heel , forced her foot into the shoe , swallowed the pain , and went out to the King ’ s Son .
He took her on his horse as his Bride , and rode away with her .
But when they passed by the hazel-tree , two little pigeons sat on it , and cried : “ _ Turn and peep , turn and peep , There ’ s blood within the shoe !
The shoe it is too small for her , The true Bride waits for you ! _ ” He looked down at her foot , and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe , and how it had stained her white stocking .
Then he turned his horse and took the false Bride home again .
“ This also is not the right one , ” said he .
“ Have you no other daughter ? ” “ No , ” said the man ; “ there is only a little stunted kitchen-girl which my late wife left behind her , but she cannot possibly be the Bride . ” The King ’ s Son said he was to send her up to him ; but the mother answered , “ Oh , no , she is much too dirty , she cannot show herself ! ” He insisted on it , and Ash-Maiden had to be called .
She first washed her hands and face clean , and then went and bowed down before the King ’ s Son , who gave her the golden shoe .
Then she seated herself on a stool , drew her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe , and put it into the slipper , which fitted like a glove .
And when she rose up and the King ’ s Son looked at her face he recognized the beautiful maiden who had danced with him , and cried , “ That is the true Bride ! ” The mother and the two sisters were terrified and became pale with rage .
He , however , took Ash-Maiden on his horse and rode away with her .
As they passed by the hazel-tree , the two white doves cried : “ _ Turn and peep , turn and peep , No blood is in the shoe !
The shoe is not too small for her , The true Bride rides with you ! _ ” and when they had cried that , the two came flying down and placed themselves on Ash-Maiden ’ s shoulders , one on the right , the other on the left , and remained sitting there .
When the wedding with the King ’ s Son had to be celebrated , the two false sisters came and wanted to get into favor with Ash-Maiden and share her good fortune .
When the betrothed couple went to church , the elder was at the right side and the younger at the left , and the pigeons pecked out one eye of each of them .
Afterward as they came back , the elder was at the left , and the younger at the right , and then the pigeons pecked out the other eye of each .
And thus , for their wickedness and falsehood , they were punished with blindness as long as they lived .
&#91; Illustration &#93; THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER A shoemaker , by no fault of his own , had become so poor that at last he had nothing left but leather for one pair of shoes .
So in the evening , he cut out the shoes which he wished to make the next morning .
And as he had a good conscience , he lay down quietly in his bed , commended himself to God , and fell asleep .
In the morning , after he had said his prayers , and was just going to sit down to work , lo !
both shoes stood all finished on his table .
He was astounded , and did not know what to say .
He took the shoes in his hands to examine them closer , and they were so neatly made that there was not one bad stitch in them , just as if they were meant for a masterpiece .
Soon after , a buyer came in , and as the shoes pleased him well , he paid more for them than was customary .
And , with the money , the shoemaker was able to purchase leather for two pairs of shoes .
He cut them out at night , and next morning was about to set to work with fresh courage ; but he had no need to do so , for , when he got up , they were already made .
And buyers also were not wanting , who gave him money enough to buy leather for four pairs of shoes .
The following morning , too , he found the four pairs made .
And so it went on constantly , what he cut out in the evening was finished by morning , so that he soon had his honest living again , and at last became a wealthy man .
Now it befell that , one evening not long before Christmas , when the man had been cutting out , he said to his wife , before going to bed , “ What think you , if we were to stay up to-night to see who it is that lends us this helping hand ? ” The woman liked the idea , and lighted a candle , and then they hid themselves in a corner of the room , behind some clothes which were hanging there , and watched .
When it was midnight , two pretty tiny naked Little Men came , sat down by the shoemaker ’ s table , took all the work which was cut out before them and began to stitch , sew , and hammer so skilfully and so quickly with their little fingers , that the shoemaker could not turn away his eyes for astonishment .
They did not stop until all was done , and stood finished on the table , and then they ran quickly away .
Next morning , the woman said , “ The Little Men have made us rich , and we really must show that we are grateful for it .
They run about so much , and have nothing on , and must be cold .
I ’ ll tell you what I ’ ll do .
I will make them little shirts , coats , vests , and trousers , and knit both of them a pair of stockings .
Do you make them two little pairs of shoes . ” The man said , “ I shall be very glad to do it . ” &#91; Illustration : THE ELVES BEGAN TO STITCH , SEW , AND HAMMER &#93; And one night , when everything was ready , they laid their presents , instead of the cut-out work , all together on the table , and then concealed themselves to see how the Little Men would behave .
At midnight they came bounding in , and wanted to get to work at once .
But as they did not find any leather cut out , only the pretty little articles of clothing , they were at first astonished , and then they showed intense delight .
They dressed themselves with the greatest rapidity , putting the pretty clothes on , and singing : “ _ Now we are boys so fine to see , Why should we longer cobblers be ? _ ” Then they danced and skipped and leapt over chairs and benches .
At last , they danced out of doors .
From that time forth they came no more , but as long as the shoemaker lived all went well with him , and all his undertakings prospered .
&#91; Illustration &#93; THE THREE BROTHERS There was once a man who had three sons , and nothing else in the world but the house in which he lived .
Now each of the sons wished to have the house after his father ’ s death ; but the father loved them all alike , and did not know what to do .
He did not wish to sell the house , because it had belonged to his forefathers , else he might have divided the money amongst them .
At last a plan came into his head , and he said to his sons , “ Go into the world , and try each of you to learn a trade .
When you all come back , he who makes the best masterpiece shall have the house . ” The sons were well content with this , and the eldest determined to be a blacksmith , the second a barber , and the third a fencing-master .
They fixed a time when they should all come home again , and then each went his way .
It chanced that they all found skilful masters , who taught them their trades well .
The blacksmith had to shoe the King ’ s horses , and he thought to himself , “ The house is mine , without doubt . ” The barber shaved only great people , and he too already looked upon the house as his own .
The fencing-master got many a blow , but he only bit his lip , and let nothing vex him ; “ for , ” said he to himself , “ if you are afraid of a blow , you ’ ll never win the house . ” When the appointed time had gone by , the three brothers came back home to their father .
But they did not know how to find the best opportunity for showing their skill , so they sat down and consulted together .
As they were sitting thus , all at once a hare came running across the field .
“ Ah , ha , just in time ! ” said the barber .
So he took his basin and soap , and lathered away until the hare came up .
Then he soaped and shaved off the hare ’ s whiskers whilst he was running at the top of his speed , and did not even cut his skin or injure a hair on his body .
“ Well done ! ” said the old man , “ your brothers will have to exert themselves wonderfully , or the house will be yours . ” Soon after , up came a nobleman in his coach , dashing along at full speed .
“ Now you shall see what I can do , Father , ” said the blacksmith .
So away he ran after the coach , took all four shoes off the feet of one of the horses whilst he was galloping , and put on four new shoes without stopping him .
“ You are a fine fellow , and as clever as your brother , ” said his father .
“ I do not know to which I ought to give the house . ” Then the third son said , “ Father , let me have my turn , if you please . ” And , as it was beginning to rain , he drew his sword , and flourished it backward and forward above his head so fast that not a drop fell upon him .
It rained still harder and harder , till at last it came down in torrents .
But he only flourished his sword faster and faster , and remained as dry as if he were sitting in a house .
When his father saw this he was amazed , and said , “ This is the masterpiece , the house is yours ! ” His brothers were satisfied with this , as was agreed before-hand .
And , as they loved one another very much , they all three stayed together in the house , followed their trades , and , as they had learnt them so well and were so clever , they earned a great deal of money .
Thus they lived together Happily , until they grew old .
And at last , when one of them fell sick and died , the two others grieved so sorely about it that they also fell ill , and soon after died .
And because they had been so clever , and had loved one another so much , they were all laid in the same grave .
&#91; Illustration &#93; LITTLE TABLE SET THYSELF , GOLD-ASS , AND CUDGEL OUT OF THE SACK There was once upon a time , a tailor , who had three sons and only one goat .
But as the goat supported the whole of them with her milk , she was obliged to have good food , and to be taken every day to pasture .
The sons , therefore , did this , in turn .
Once , the eldest took her to the churchyard , where the finest herbs were to be found , and let her eat and run about there .
At night , when it was time to go home , he asked , “ Goat , have you had enough ? ” The goat answered : “ _ I have eaten so much , Not a leaf more I ’ ll touch , Ma !
Ma ! _ ” “ Come home , then , ” said the youth , and took hold of the cord round her neck , led her into the stable and tied her up securely .
“ Well , ” said the old tailor , “ has the goat had as much food as she ought ? ” “ Oh , ” answered the son , “ she has eaten so much , not a leaf more she ’ ll touch . ” But the father wished to satisfy himself , and went down to the stable , stroked the dear animal and asked , “ Goat , are you satisfied ? ” The goat answered : “ _ With what should I be satisfied ?
Among the graves I leapt about , And found no food , so went without , Ma !
Ma ! _ ” “ What do I hear ? ” cried the tailor , and ran up-stairs and said to the youth , “ Hollo , you liar ; you said the goat had had enough , and have let her go hungry ! ” and in his anger , he took the yard-measure from the wall , and drove him out with blows .
Next day , it was the turn of the second son , who looked out for a place in the fence of the garden , where nothing but good herbs grew .
And the goat cleared them all off .
At night , when he wanted to go home , he asked , “ Goat , are you satisfied ? ” The goat answered : “ _ I have eaten so much , Not a leaf more I ’ ll touch , Ma !
Ma ! _ ” “ Come home , then , ” said the youth , and led her home and tied her up in the stable .
“ Well , ” said the old tailor , “ has the goat had as much food as she ought ? ” “ Oh , ” answered the son , “ she has eaten so much , not a leaf more she ’ ll touch . ” The tailor would not rely on this , but went down to the stable and said , “ Goat , have you had enough ? ” The goat answered : “ _ With what should I be satisfied ?
Among the graves I leapt about , And found no food , so went without , Ma !
Ma ! _ ” “ The godless wretch ! ” cried the tailor , “ to let such a good animal go hungry , ” and he ran up and drove the youth out of doors with the yard-measure .
Now came the turn of the third son , who wanted to do the thing well , and sought out some bushes with the finest leaves , and let the goat devour them .
In the evening when he wanted to go home , he asked , “ Goat , have you had enough ? ” The goat answered : “ _ I have eaten so much , Not a leaf more I ’ ll touch , Ma !
Ma ! _ ” “ Come home , then , ” said the youth , and led her into the stable , and tied her up .
“ Well , ” said the old tailor , “ has the goat had a proper amount of food ? ” “ She has eaten so much , not a leaf more she ’ ll touch . ” The tailor did not trust to that , but went down and asked , “ Goat , have you had enough ? ” The wicked beast answered : “ _ With what should I be satisfied ?
Among the graves I leapt about , And found no leaves , so went without , Ma !
Ma ! _ ” “ Oh , the brood of liars ! ” cried the tailor , “ each as wicked and forgetful of his duty as the other !
Ye shall no longer make a fool of me , ” and , quite beside himself with anger , he ran up-stairs and belabored the poor young fellow so vigorously with the yard-measure that he sprang out of the house .
The old tailor was now alone with his goat .
Next morning he went down into the stable , caressed the goat and said , “ Come , my dear little animal , I myself will take you to feed . ” He took her by the rope and conducted her to green hedges , and amongst milfoil , and whatever else goats like to eat .
“ There you may for once eat to your heart ’ s content , ” said he to her , and let her browse till evening .
Then he asked , “ Goat , are you satisfied ? ” She replied : “ _ I have eaten so much , Not a leaf more I ’ ll touch , Ma !
Ma ! _ ” “ Come home , then , ” said the tailor , and led her into the stable , and tied her fast .
When he was going away , he turned round again and said , “ Well , are you satisfied for once ? ” But the goat did not behave better to him , and cried : “ _ With what should I be satisfied ?
Among the graves I leapt about , And found no leaves , so went without , Ma !
Ma ! _ ” When the tailor heard that , he was shocked , and saw clearly that he had driven away his three sons without cause .
“ Wait , you ungrateful creature , ” cried he , “ it is not enough to drive you forth , I will mark you so that you will no more dare to show yourself amongst honest tailors ! ” In great haste , he ran up-stairs , fetched his razor , lathered the goat ’ s head , and shaved her as clean as the palm of his hand .
And as the yard-measure would have been too good for her , he brought the horsewhip , and gave her such cuts with it that she ran away with mighty leaps .
When the tailor was thus left quite alone in his house , he fell into great grief , and would gladly have had his sons back again .
