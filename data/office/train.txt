mellow music Tonight is the Dundies , the annual employee awards night here at Dunder Mifflin .
And this is everybody &apos;s favorite day .
Everybody looks forward to it .
Because , you know , a lot of the people here don &apos;t get trophies very often .
Like Meredith or Kevin .
I mean , who &apos;s gonna give Kevin an award , Dunkin &apos; Donuts ?
Plus , bonus , it &apos;s really , really funny .
So I--You know , an employee will go home , and he &apos;ll tell his neighbor , &quot; Hey , did you get an award ? &quot;
And the neighbor &apos;ll say , &quot; No , man . &quot;
I mean , I slave all day .
Nobody notices me .
Next thing you know , employee smells something terrible coming from the neighbor &apos;s house .
Neighbor &apos;s hanged himself .
Due to lack of recognition .
So ... Wow .
Those are , um ... gleaming .
You buy a new pair every day , or ...
I like keeping them new-looking .
Jim chuckles So you ready for ... the Dundies ?
Ugh .
( Pam ) You know what they say about a car wreck , where it &apos;s so awful , you can &apos;t look away ?
The Dundies are like a car wreck that you wanna look away but you have to stare at it because your boss is making you .
Hey-hey-hey !
It &apos;s Fat Halpert !
What ?
Fat Halpert !
Jim Halpert .
So why don &apos;t I take you on a tour of past Dundie winners ?
We got Fat Jim Halpert here .
Jim , why don &apos;t you show off your Dundies to the camera ?
Oh , I can &apos;t because I keep them hidden .
I don &apos;t wanna look at them and get cocky .
Oh !
That &apos;s a good idea .
( Dwight ) And mine are at home , in a display case above my bed .
Yeeaacck !
TMI .
TMI , my friends .
( Michael ) TMI ?
Too Much Information .
Uh , it &apos;s just easier to say TMI .
I used to say &quot; Don &apos;t go there , &quot; but that &apos;s lame .
And here we have Stanley the Manley .
Now , Stanley is a Dundie all-star .
Aren &apos;t you , Stanley ?
Why don &apos;t you , uh , show them some of your bling .
I don &apos;t know where they are .
I think I threw them out .
Oh , no , you di-in &apos;t .
Uh , think I did .
Mm--Why did-- Say , we gotta order some more appe-teasers this time We ran out last year , remember ?
Yes , we should .
I--You know what ?
I wanted one of those skillets of cheese .
But when I got off stage , someone had eaten all of them .
I am psyched for the Dundies .
I got a sitter for my kid .
I am gonna drink frozen drinks paid for by Dunder Mifflin .
I &apos;m gonna eat some good Chili &apos;s food and hopefully ... meet someone nice at the bar .
I love the Dundies .
The only thing I don &apos;t like about the Dundies is that Michael thinks I have the gene for alcoholism , and so he cuts me off after like two drinks .
I usually share a table with Phyllis .
inhales , exhales Well ...
I haven &apos;t eaten anything all day .
And I think I &apos;m gonna skip lunch so that I can maximize my food at the Dundies .
I think I &apos;m gonna share some Cadillac Fajitas with Toby .
Toby is so cute ... except he has that stupid kid .
There &apos;s a lot of drinking at the Dundies , and people say very inappropriate things .
I never should have had that drink last year .
One year , I didn &apos;t go , and then what happens is Michael tells you about it over and over again .
Like for a month .
So it &apos;s-- it &apos;s less painful to go and just get it over with ... than ... than not go .
You think you &apos;re getting away with it .
Well , you &apos;re not .
Yes , I &apos;m the designated driver , which is very important .
We need everyone to get home safely .
But no one ever gives me gas money , and people live all over .
It &apos;s expensive .
inaudible conversation Pfff .
Like a gaggle of geese .
high voice Mee-mee-mee-mee .
giggling It was you .
It wasn &apos;t .
I swear .
Yeah , it was .
So what &apos;s the joke ?
You &apos;re not perfect either .
We &apos;re not laughing at you , Dwight .
So who are we laughing at ?
Um , just something somebody wrote .
Who ?
Dave Barry ?
No , no .
Just something that was written on the ladies room wall .
What is it ?
Who wrote it ?
Um , it &apos;s kind of private .
whispering It &apos;s about Michael .
giggling That is defacement of company property .
So you &apos;d better tell me .
Kelly , if you tell me , you &apos;ll be punished less .
Okay , now I &apos;m laughing at you .
giggling It hasn &apos;t always been easy being a whistleblower .
When I was in school , the kids would call me a tattletale or a snitch or a worm .
So I really identify with those women from Enron .
I wrote them letters to tell them how much they inspired me , but they never wrote back .
I guess they &apos;re all married .
All right , we need something for Kevin .
( Jim ) Mmm-hmmm .
What do we know about him ?
He &apos;s an accountant .
He plays guitar , he likes naval history .
He &apos;s a bowler .
He &apos;s fat .
The fat accountant award .
Well , you seem to have this under control .
The weird part about this whole deal is that Michael truly believes that these awards are inspiring and motivational .
I mean , he puts more effort and time and commitment into the Dundies than anything else he does all year .
Which is probably why this branch will be downsized .
( Michael ) I am the fat accountant .
Michael , I need to talk to you .
Here he is .
I just thought that you might like to know that someone has written something about you on the ladies &apos; room wall .
Really ?
What did they say ?
&quot; For a good time , call Michael Scott &quot; ?
Good one .
Uh , no , no .
No , I think something bad , maybe .
Why do you think that ?
You just immediately go to that , Dwight ?
Why are you so negative ?
Why are you-- Michael .
I mean , you just come in , and you &apos;re just negative ... Michael .
... and you just walk negatively .
Do you want me to find out what it says ?
Yes .
By any means necessary ?
What does that even mean ?
What are you ... what are you talking about ?
( Dwight ) It &apos;s the ladies &apos; room .
Just go and find out what it says and who said it and report back to me .
But don &apos;t tell anybody that I have anything to do with it , because if they ask me , I will say that you are crazy .
Thank you .
You won &apos;t regret this , Michael .
What award would you like to give Dwight ?
I hadn &apos;t planned on including him .
Okay .
Kevin .
To Oscar Martinez , it &apos;s the Show Me the Money award .
Michael has taped every Dundies Awards .
And now he &apos;s making me look through hours of footage to find highlights .
For the ladies .
Hit it , Dwight .
playing flute A little bit of Pam all night long A little bit of Angela on the thing ( Pam ) Oh , yeah .
This is the part where Kevin sat in front of the camcorder all night .
It &apos;s great .
A little bit of Roy eating chicken crispers A little bit of Tim with some ribs A little bit of Matt-- Angela , it &apos;s simple .
Just tell me what the bathroom wall says .
I don &apos;t talk about what goes on in the restroom .
I &apos;m not asking what you do in there .
I just want to know what &apos;s written about Michael .
I don &apos;t say those kinds of things out loud .
It &apos;s inappropriate .
Okay , I &apos;ll talk .
You nod if I get it right .
Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener ?
Angela sighs Will her highness Jan Levinson-Gould be descending from her corporate throne this evening to visit us lowly serfs here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton ?
It &apos;s a two-and-a-half-hour drive from New York , Michael .
Well , you could take the bus .
You could work on the way here , sleep on the way home .
No .
Come on , Jan.
This is important .
I mean , this is , this is validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this .
Well , we don &apos;t approve of this , Michael .
W-- I mean , you only have the budget for one office party a year , so ... we &apos;re not paying for this .
Um-- Can you-- ?
Are you there , Michael ?
Yeah , yeah , I &apos;m here .
I just wanted to , uh ... talk to you for a second about that .
Um , what , uh , what is-- I mean , come on !
Jan. What &apos;s--You &apos;re droppin &apos; an A-bomb on me here .
Really ?
I &apos;m dropping an atomic bomb on you ?
Well , yeah .
I mean , what is-- Right .
You already had a party on May 5th for no reason .
No reason !
It was the 05-05-05 party .
It happens once every billion years .
And you had a luau .
And the tsunami relief fundraiser , which somehow lost a lot of money .
Okay , no , that was a funraiser .
I think I made that very clear in the flyers .
Okay , well , I don &apos;t understand why anyone ... Fun .
F-U-N . ... would have a tsunami fun raiser , Michael .
Well , I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage .
All right , just watch the off-color jokes .
I got a lotta complaints from H.R.
last year .
Ugh , well , that &apos;s Toby .
Jerk-face .
He , uh ... hasn &apos;t won a Dundie , and it &apos;s sour grapes , and he &apos;s a very bitter , bitter ... Jan sighs ... young balding man .
All right .
I gotta go , Michael .
What ?
Okay .
We &apos;ll talk about this later .
No , this all sounds great .
This sounds great .
Jan , indistinct So maybe we &apos;ll see you later .
Okay .
All right , buh-bye .
Oh , let &apos;s see .
What &apos;s on the computer ?
Uh , yes , that &apos;s true .
I have never won a Dundie .
I am more than okay with that .
It &apos;s a little character I like to do .
It is , uh , loosely based on Carnac , one of Carson &apos;s classic characters .
Here we go .
The PLO , the IRA , and the hot dog stand behind the warehouse .
rips envelope Name three businesses that have better healthcare plans than Dunder Mifflin .
Here &apos;s the problem .
There &apos;s no open bar because of Jan. And it &apos;s the reason why comedy clubs have a two-drink minimum .
I mean , it &apos;ll be fine , I just ... wish people were gonna be drunk .
I think his characters are pretty funny .
Especially Ping .
Well , what should I do , guys ?
Seriously , do you want me to just cancel the Dundies ?
No , we were just hoping you wouldn &apos;t do those characters like last time .
Ping ?
Everybody loves Ping .
He &apos;s my most popular character .
I think many people find that character slightly racist .
Really ?
Well , he is based on the Chinese delivery guy that I have who talks exactly like that , so I think you should take it up with him instead of me .
Well , I &apos;m just saying there are many people that are offended by your insensitive skits .
sighs Well , neither of you are Chinese , so what ... Why do you care ?
( Phyllis ) Dwight , get out of here .
What are you doing in the ladies room ?
It &apos;s not what you-- No !
Why were you in there ?
You are a pervert !
What were you doing in there ?
I am not .
I &apos;m telling Michael .
I am on official business .
Michael !
Phyllis , you are not .
Michael !
No--stop it !
Stop it !
Michael .
Michael--no , do not listen to her .
Dwight was in the ladies room , and he was looking at me .
What ?
This is not true .
He was looking at me in the ladies &apos; room .
That is totally unfair !
I was just in the ladies &apos; room in order to spy .
Dwight , Dwight , that--you &apos;ve hit an new low , my friend .
That &apos;s what I said !
He was spying in the ladies &apos; room .
What do you think , Phyllis ?
You think I followed you in there like , &quot; Oh good .
Phyllis is going to the bathroom , so maybe I get to see her naked from the waist down . &quot;
I &apos;m not even attracted to you .
That is a good point .
Write him up , or I &apos;ll take it to Jan.
Okay , all right , I will do that .
I will get to that definitely .
Absolutely .
When ?
Oh , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe after I finish writing , producing , directing , and hosting your awards show , all right ?
Just relax , keep your pants on .
Unless , of course , you &apos;re in the bathroom and you should be able to take your pants off in that case without Creepsville Central spying on you .
Good .
The Dundie award for longest engagement goes to Pam Beesley .
Pam , everybody !
Yoo !
When is that girl gonna get married ?
That &apos;s what I have to say .
Aha , Roy &apos;s accepting .
Thank you , Roy , are there any words you &apos;d like to say on Pam &apos;s behalf ?
( Roy ) Uh , we &apos;ll see you next year .
( Michael ) Yeah !
Oh , hope not !
Hope not .
I &apos;m not changing that .
That &apos;s the best one .
No , it &apos;s hilarious .
You &apos;re right .
I just think , um , World &apos;s Longest Engagement , um , we &apos;re all expecting it , you know ?
That &apos;s why it &apos;s funny .
Every year that Roy and Pam don &apos;t get married it gets funnier .
Well , I think if you use the same jokes , it just comes across as lazy .
Oh .
Lazy .
Uh-huh .
Excuse me , everyone .
Can I have your attention , please ?
I just wanted to say that the women in this office are terrible .
Especially the ones who wrote that stuff about Michael on the bathroom wall .
Having a bathroom is a privilege .
It is called a ladies &apos; room for a reason .
And if you cannot behave like ladies , well , then , you are not going to have a bathroom .
You &apos;re taking away our bathroom ?
We are going to have two men &apos;s rooms .
But where would we--go ?
Be prepared to hold it , folks .
Okay , okay .
From 9 : 00 a.m.-- Look .
( Pam ) Michael ...
Yes ?
Dwight &apos;s banning us from our bathroom .
Okay , well , that &apos;s ridiculous .
So just don &apos;t-- I don &apos;t have time for this right now .
There needs to be repercussions for people &apos;s behavior .
Stop it !
Stop it !
Okay .
Look , I know there have been a lot of rumors flying around about the Dundies this year , how there is no money and how there is no food , and how the jokes are really bad .
But , what the hell , everybody ?
I mean-- God , the Dundies are about the best in every one of us .
Can &apos;t you see that ?
I mean-- Okay , we can do better .
( Michael ) So tonight , for the first time , we are inviting all of your friends and family to attend the awards with us .
Yes .
( Michael ) Yeah , not bad , right ?
So let &apos;s make this the best Dundies ever .
claps hands Best Dundies ever .
All right , let &apos;s wrap it up .
Come on , we &apos;re late .
The Dundies are starting very soon .
Accounting , let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go .
Okay , I gave you fair warning .

Who &apos;s next , customer service ?
Meredith , let &apos;s roll .

But the kid &apos;s having a really good time .
So you &apos;re kind of there .
That &apos;s--that &apos;s kind of what it &apos;s like .

So we are here .
Thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards .
I am your host , Michael Scott .
So , Pam , I wonder who &apos;s gonna get &quot; longest engagement &quot; this year .
Well , you &apos;re not gonna get longest engagement , man , &apos; cause we got that locked up .
I wonder what I &apos;ll get .
I brought my fiancée .
And I just wanna tell you , please , please , do not drink and drive .
Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink .
I &apos;ll just put these on the group tab .
Nope , actually , this year , no group tab .
We &apos;re gonna be doing separate checks .

Um , good .
Speaking of relationships of all-- all waves , shapes , and forms , um , I was out on a very , very hot date last night with a girl from H.R. , Dwight .
Really ?
We don &apos;t have any girls from H.R.
No , uh ... F-for the sake of the story .
And things were getting hot and heavy .
( Dwight ) Yeah ?
And I was about to take her bra off , when she had me fill out six hours &apos; worth of paperwork .

All right , our next award ... ah , yes , this award goes to the most creative writing on the ladies &apos; room wall , and the winner is ... Who is it ?
Who wants to claim it ?
Shiny Dundie .

We got to see Ping .
And we learned Michael &apos;s true feelings for Ryan .
Which was touching .
And we heard Michael change the lyrics to a number of classic songs .
Which for me , has ruined them for life .
Michael singing I &apos;ve Had the Time of My Life What ?
Nothing .
Okay .
What ?
I don &apos;t know , what ?
Oh , my God .
You are so drunk .
Did you get that ?

We need to cushion her head .
Lie still .

Dwight , Dwight .
I &apos;m sorry .
laughing I am fine .
Jim , don &apos;t interfere .
You have to put your clothes back on .
People are trying to eat .
Can you give me a second , sir ?
No !
Dwight , let me up .
Right now .
I am a Sheriff &apos;s Deputy .
That &apos;s fine .
I could have my men in here in a second and have you arrested .
Pam , are you all right ?
I &apos;m fine .
Sir , sir .
How many fingers am I holding up ?
You &apos;re holding up three fingers .
Are you okay ?
Put your clothes on , right now .
I will .
I will .
You need to calm down .
Was this year &apos;s Dundies a success ?
Well , let me see .
I made Pam laugh so hard that she fell out of her chair .
And she almost broke her neck .
So I killed .
Almost .
laughs Oh , my God !
I just wanna say , that this was the best Dundies ever !
Whoo !
Whoa , whoa .
Careful , careful , careful .
Don &apos;t wanna forget that .
You and your party really need to leave right now .

I-- You know what ?
Don &apos;t worry about it .
Keep it .
My gift .
Thank you .
Have a good night .
See you next year .
That &apos;s ... fine .
We have a strict policy here not to over-serve .
( waiter ) Apparently this young woman was sneaking drinks off other people &apos;s tables .
I Xeroxed her driver &apos;s license , and she is not welcome at this restaurant chain ever again .
clicks tongue Great work tonight .
Watch your step .
Excellent .
Thanks .
I had to , uh , check her pupils to make sure that wasn &apos;t a concussion .
Yes , that too , but I mean with the audio .
Great , great work .
I feel bad about what I wrote on the bathroom wall .
No , you don &apos;t .
laughs Oh , here she is .
sighs Careful , careful , whoa .
laughs All right .
Easy .
Almost there .
Hey , um , can I ask you a question ?

Good night .

Thank you , Angela .
( Elton John ) Hold me closer , Tiny Dancer You had a busy day today Hold me closer , Tiny Dancer One sombrero-- $ 20 .
People leaving without paying and sticking me with a bill for $ 400 ... $ 400 .
Making someone laugh until they puke ... Priceless .
My favorite Dundies moment ?
I think it &apos;s when Angela tied the cherry stem with her mouth .
A couple of years ago , I got an award for tying a cherry stem with my tongue .
I won &apos;t do that anymore .
She ... she kinda went like ...
It was pretty cool .
As for the bill , big deal .
People didn &apos;t pay , and I got stuck with a tab for $ 400 .
The joke is on them .
Do you realize how many airline miles that is ?
Six more years , and I will see you in Mardi Gras .
upbeat music Good morning , Pam .
( Pam ) Good morning , Michael .
What &apos;s going on ?
Nothing .
You look nice today .
You look real thin .
Um ...
Uh , I don &apos;t get what you mean .
You just , um , you look good .
Your shirt looks ... you look real good .
Uh ... Well , you said I look thin , so what does-- That mean I &apos;m , like , thin weird , or thin handsome , or ... laughs Thin handsome , Michael .
Ah .
Yes , well , of course .
Of course .
I &apos;m in a good mood .
My mom is coming in to visit .
She lives , like , two hours away and she doesn &apos;t have a cell phone .
Which is cool &apos; cause it &apos;s kind of adding some suspense to my day , and I keep looking over at the door , hoping she &apos;ll walk in .
clears throat Hey , what &apos;s up ?
Hey .
Any emails today ?
Um , I don &apos;t think so .
No ?
Um , check your spam folder .
Oh , there it is .
What ?
Um ... 50 signs your priest might be Michael Jackson .
Well done .
Topical .
I am king of forwards .
It &apos;s how I like to do business .
Everybody joking around .
We &apos;re like Friends .
I am Chandler .
And Joey .
And , uh , Pam is Rachel .
And Dwight is Kramer .
laughing Did you get it ?
both laughing both muttering , laughing Got any emails ?
Anything funny happening in there ?
Oh , yeah .
The one from corporate ?
Yeah--what ?
That &apos;s crazy , about Randall .
What ?
&quot; Informing you that Randall Einhorn , our CFO , has resigned due to inappropriate conduct . &quot;
Wow .
That is out of the blue .
&quot; We hope that this information will put an end to the rumors . &quot;
I did hear rumors ... Mm-hmm .
About him .
That is something .
So the monkey does the sex thing right ... here !
both laugh ( Michael ) That &apos;s funny !
That &apos;s funny .
Not offensive .
Because it &apos;s nature , educational .
Do want the link ?
&apos;Cause then you could forward it around .
Um , I ...
Consider it .
Maybe , maybe .
Well , we &apos;ll see .
Because I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s a-- Wha--come on !
What has two thumbs and likes to bone your mom ?
This guy !
both laugh Oh , you are so bad .
Yeah .
Oh , phew , ro , rah !
Aaah !
Oh , this guy is out of control .
He is a madman .
Better get the bleep button ready for him .
Bleep , bleep !
What &apos;s up , Halpert ?
Still queer ?
( Michael ) Uh-oh !
Oh ho ho !
Todd Packer and I are total BFF .
Best friends forever .
He and I came up together as salesmen .
One time we were out and we met this set of twins .
And Packer told them that we were brothers .
And so , you know , one thing led to another .
And we brought &apos; em back to the motel .
And then Packer did both of them .
It was awesome .
It was ...
I was about to close this order , and it was a really big one .
That &apos;s what she said .
both laughing Oh , man , did you get that ?
&quot; That &apos;s what she said . &quot;
Please don &apos;t involve me in this .
Nice !
That is a classic .
Oh , oh , oh !
Oh .
Okay , grade-A gossip for you right now .
Randall , CFO , resigned .
Nobody knows why .
Are you kidding ?
Everyone knows why !
You don &apos;t know ?
Oh , okay , check this out .
All right , so here &apos;s the story .
So Randall is nailing his secretary , right ?
And she &apos;s totally incompetent .
Really ?
Here we go .
Buckle up , it &apos;s gonna be a bumpy one .
We &apos;re talking &quot; blonde incompetent , &quot; right ?
Oh , yeah .
Like , uh , ten words a minute .
Talking .
Well , to be fair , blondes , brunettes .
You know , there are a lot of dumb people out there .
They are women , right ?
Oh , wow !
I didn &apos;t say it !
I didn &apos;t say it !
I said it .
And then , suddenly , for no reason , this bimbo asks for a pay raise , right ?
Really ?
Yeah , and Randall &apos;s like , &quot; Uh , I &apos;m not giving a pay raise to someone whose bra size is twice her IQ . &quot;
Oh , wow !
Some people don &apos;t test well .
Okay , I &apos;m telling the story .
So anyway , this bimbo blows the whistle on the whole thing just to be a bitch .
Oh , wow , what &apos;d I tell you about the bleep button ?
Hey , what has two thumbs and hates Todd Packer ?
This guy !
So , uh , what are you , uh , what are you around ?
You doing sales calls in the area ?
What &apos;s going on ?
I meant to ask you , you think you can get someone to drive me around because of the DUI situation ?
Oh , bad boy .
Um , Ryan .
makes quacking duck sound Come on , kid , let &apos;s go .
Oh , man .
That Todd Packer can do anything .
Except pass that breathalyzer .
( Todd ) They key is , when you get pulled over , you just stall &apos; em for as long as you can , or you just start crying , you know ?
You a big William Hung fan ?
Why does everybody ask me that ?
Who the hell is that ?
Wait , Jim , no .
Don &apos;t drink directly from the can , okay ?
I &apos;m serious .
It &apos;s all over the Internet .
They use the same shipping company as a rat poison , and it gets on the can .
Well , you &apos;re an idiot .
What can I say , Dwight ?
I live a very dangerous life .
email chimes monkey screeching snickers Did you get that ?
Yeah , I got it .
You could see her-- It &apos;s fake .
How do you know ?
She wouldn &apos;t do that .
She &apos;s a senator .
snickers Oh , that &apos;s funny .
Ow !
Hey .
Hey .
Whoa , a little early for your 4 : 00 candy , isn &apos;t it ?
Yeah , I know .
I &apos;m just , like , a little bit , you know ... Gotcha .
I &apos;m really excited to meet your mom .
You are ?
Yeah .
I &apos;m excited to show her around .
She really wants to meet everybody .
Oh , yeah ?
Good .
&apos;Cause I have a lot of questions .
Oh , really ?
Yeah .
As a child did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist ?
Oh , yes .
When Pam was a little girl , she used to answer the phone and press the hold button for hours , every day .
That &apos;s incredible .
She was just a natural .
laughs Hey , send me that link to the monkey sex video .
I &apos;m going to forward it like it &apos;s hot .
Yes !
Forward it like it &apos;s hot Forward it like it &apos;s hot Old school .
Michael ?
Yes , Toby .
Um , I need to talk to you in your office .
It &apos;ll just take two seconds .
clears throat Um , literally two seconds ?
Toby is in HR , which technically means he works for corporate .
So he &apos;s really not a part of our family .
Also , he &apos;s divorced , so he &apos;s really not a part of his family .
The full story is that Randall resigned because of sexual harassment .
So corporate asked me to do a five minute review of the company &apos;s sexual harassment policy .
No , no , Toby .
No .
It &apos;s really not a big deal , Michael .
It is a big deal .
It &apos;s a big deal !
What are we supposed to do , scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day ?
I mean , come on .
And then corporate is gonna send in a lawyer .
What ?
No !
Just to refresh you on our policy .
What ?
N-he--no .
Okay , what is a lawyer gonna come in and tell us ?
To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes ?
Maybe not some of them .
Maybe not inappropriate ones .
There is no such thing as an appropriate joke .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s a joke .
Everyone ?
Hello ?
Everyone .
Hi .
Uh , sorry to interrupt .
I know you &apos;re all busy and the last thing you want is for a major interruption .
But Toby has an announcement that he insists on making right now in the middle of the day .
So take it away .
Yeah , okay .
Corporate would like us to do a five minute review of the company &apos;s sexual harassment policy , so I &apos;ll go over that later .
( Michael ) I wish you luck , Toby , I really do .
But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands .
And I just can &apos;t wait to see how you handle it .
A guy goes to a five dollar ... lady of the night .
And he gets crabs .
So the next day , he goes back to complain .
And the woman says , &quot; Hey , it was only five dollars .
What did you expect , lobster ? &quot;
laughs softly This is what &apos;s at stake .
Hey .
Hey .
I know we &apos;re having that harassment thing this afternoon .
Yeah .
Some times when we IM , I send you that little winking face with the lipstick .
Yeah ?
Yeah .
I realized that might be harassment .
Yes , it is harassment .
And I &apos;m gonna be suing the winking face .
I &apos;ve hired the angry face as my lawyer , and you should be hearing from him very soon .
Okay .
Okay .
laughing elevator bell Time to bring out the big guns .
I am heading down to the warehouse , where jokes are born .
Find a killer joke that &apos;ll just blow everybody away at the seminar later .
And remind them what is great about this place .
So ... ah !
Here they are .
Guys , wondering if I could , uh , get your help for something ?
I am looking for a new joke to tell .
And it needs to be just killer .
And it does not need to be clean .
So what you got ?
Like , a joke ?
A knock , knock joke ?
Um , yeah--no .
I mean , better .
Better than that .
The type of stuff you guys tell all day .
Well , those are some awful tight pants you have on .
Where did you get &apos; em , like , Queers &apos; R &apos; Us ?
Boys &apos; R &apos; Us .
Oh !
All right , all right .
Well , yeah , but you know .
A joke but not necessarily at my expense .
Man , we can see all your business coming around the corner , okay ?
You need to , you know , hide that .
Good thing you don &apos;t have a lot of business to start with .
Ohhhh , okay .
That was still about me .
Hey , hey , hey .
So you don &apos;t have the biggest package .
Don &apos;t feel bad .
I don &apos;t feel bad .
I think he feels bad .
No , I don &apos;t .
You look like you feel bad .
Okay , well ... You know , not exactly what I was looking for .
But thanks , guys .
Thank you !
You look good in those pants .
He get it from his mama !
catcalling So , remember , intent is irrelevant .
And that &apos;s it .
Pam .
Um , I just wanted to say that--just , my mom &apos;s coming in today .
Mmmmilf .
Thanks , Kevin .
Usually the day we talk about sexual harassment is the day that everyone harasses me as a joke .
She &apos;s coming in today , and maybe just don &apos;t joke around about that stuff in front of her ?
Great point .
Uh , in fact , uh , basic rule of thumb .
Let &apos;s just act every day like Pam &apos;s mom is coming in .
All right , that &apos;s it .
If anybody has any questions about anything , you know where I sit in the back .
applause Hi , is it over ?
Uh , yes .
No .
I know , I know .
It &apos;s good .
It is not over .
It is not over &apos; til it &apos;s over .
Did he tell you everything ?
Obviously he didn &apos;t , because you all still look relatively happy , albeit bored .
Do you realize what we &apos;re losing ?
Seriously .
Email forwards .
Exactly .
Mwah .
Can we afford to lose email forwards ?
Do we want that ?
I hate them .
You send me these filthy emails .
And you say , &quot; Forward them to 10 people , or you &apos;ll have bad luck . &quot;
Give me a break .
Um , Stanley how about that hot picture you have by your desk ?
The centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl &apos;s outfit ?
I mean , it is hot , it is sexy , and it turns him on .
And I will admit , best part of my morning is staring at it .
But what , are we just gonna take it away ?
That is my daughter .
She goes to Catholic girls &apos; school .
Great !
He can leave it up !
I &apos;m taking it down right now .
Leave it up , Stanley .
Leave it up !
Fight the good fight !
Um , what about office romance ?
Good point .
Yes .
Office romance .
For example , Pam and I are dating .
Do we have to disclose that ?
We &apos;re not dating .
No , but I &apos;m saying hypothetically if we were dating .
We &apos;re not dating .
I &apos;m engaged .
Well , Roy is dead , and I ask you out .
I would say no .
You say yes , and we go out .
I would drown myself .
And now Roy and Pam are dead , and we have your stupid rules to blame , Toby !
Office relationships are never a good idea , so let &apos;s just try to avoid &apos; em .
But if you already have one , you should disclose it to HR .
Um , all relationships ?
Even a one-night stand ?
Uh , full disclosure .
Dwight and his electric pencil sharpener are dating .
Uh , no , we &apos;re not .
Well , you said you hooked up .
Damn it , Dwight .
Okay , question .
When does this policy go into effect ?
Immediately .
imitates buzzer Wrong , no .
New policies go into effect next business day .
( Toby ) Okay , Dwight .
( Michael ) I think the old honor system was fine .
For example , I have never slept with an employee .
And believe me , I could have .
Yeah , Meredith .
No , no , Catherine .
Remember her ?
Remember how hot she was ?
She would have definitely slept with me .
She wasn &apos;t that hot .
Yes , she was .
Damn it , Kevin !
I &apos;m in an office relationship .
It &apos;s special .
Mmm , she &apos;s nice , she &apos;s shy .
She &apos;s actually here if you wanna meet her .
Hold on a second .
Oh , my God .
Put on a shirt !
Put--I told you that you &apos;d be on camera .
I &apos;m sorry , she &apos;s European .
No , I told you that you &apos;d be on camera .
Stop .
There really isn &apos;t a problem here .
You are trying to outlaw jokes .
Is that why you &apos;re bringing in an attorney ?
Is that-- he &apos;s bringing in a lawyer .
( Toby ) You know , some of these jokes , you can just tell on your free time with your friends .
Here &apos;s what he doesn &apos;t understand .
This is our free time .
These are our friends .
And I think we have a right to make our own rules .
I saw the most hilarious monkey sex video on the Internet this morning with Michael .
I don &apos;t want things like that to change .
What if Pam was a lesbian ?
What if she brought her &quot; partner &quot; into work ?
Would that be crossing the line ?
No .
What if they made out in front of everybody ?
Well , that would be-- At home ?
And I told everybody everything about it ?
Okay , I &apos;m lost .
Okay .
Well , then , let &apos;s act it out .
Pam , you will be girl A.
And girl B will be ...
Okay , we &apos;ll use the doll .
Pam ?
Pam ?
I wish Todd Packer was here , &apos; cause he would love this .
I wonder if anybody else would like to join us .
Oop .
Coming out of my mouth .
Hey , um , we have to watch Toby &apos;s video that he &apos;s showing us in order to brainwash us .
And I was wondering if anybody &apos;d like to join in ?
Gonna be fun .
Got microwave pizza .
What do you say ?
Jim ?
No , thanks , I &apos;m good .
That &apos;s what she said .
Pam ?
Um , my mother &apos;s coming .
That &apos;s what she said-- clears throat No , but--okay .
Well , suit yourself .
Hey , Toby .
Hey , Dwight .
You said that we could come to you if we had any questions .
Sure .
Where is the clitoris ?
On a website it said on the crest of the labia .
What does that mean ?
What does the female vagina look like ?
Technically , I am in human resources .
And Dwight was asking about human anatomy .
Um , I &apos;m just sad the public school system failed him so badly .
You know , maybe when you get really comfortable with each other , you can ask for that .
Good .
Good .
And-- I should get back to work .
Okay .
In today &apos;s fast-paced business climate , it can sometimes be hard to know when a comment or an action crosses the line .
Let &apos;s take a look at a couple of scenarios and ask ourselves , where is the line ?
The natural redhead .
Hey , Marie .
Hey , Joe , Mike .
Hey , settle a bet .
Are you a natural redhead ?
laughter Nah , she ain &apos;t red .
No , none of them are , man .
What does that even-- how does that even bad , asking if you &apos;re a redhead ?
Oh my--hey , stop the video !
Wait , go--stop it right there .
Stop it right there .
That &apos;s that girl from that thing .
I banged this girl right here .
That &apos;s her ?
Yes , this is the one .
You remember ... No , the party ?
You banged her ?
Right here .
You are a naughty girl .
Whoa , whoa , whoa .
Okay , hypocrite .
Okay , she is a hypocrite .
That is such a scam .
Okay .
Yes ?
Yes , I did .
Okay .
Well , we can talk about that later then .
Okay , you are never gonna believe this .
The girl in the video we &apos;re watching that corporate gave us .
Darryl banged her !
And ...
He &apos;s about 90 % sure .
Don &apos;t ever let this little bitch drive you around town .
We got lost for half an hour .
I don &apos;t have any DUIs , so l can drive myself .
But thanks .
Where is Michael Snot ?
Sniffing some dude &apos;s thong ?
Probably .
So you are the lawyer , Mr. O &apos;Malley .
I know a lot of lawyer jokes .
I love lawyer jokes .
Well , it &apos;s probably because you don &apos;t get &apos; em .
When I said before that I was king of forwards , you gotta understand that I don &apos;t come up with this stuff .
I just forward it along .
You wouldn &apos;t arrest a guy who &apos;s just delivering drugs from one guy to another .
You seem a little bit agitated , Michael .
What &apos;s the problem ?
The problem is that ...
I am the boss .
And apparently I can &apos;t say anything .
Well , that &apos;s--that &apos;s true in a way .
You can &apos;t say &quot; anything . &quot;
Where &apos;s the line ?
Where &apos;s the line , Jan ?
Do you need to see the video again , Michael ?
No , I &apos;ve seen the video .
He talked the whole time .
No , I didn &apos;t .
sighs What ?
Attention , everyone .
Hello ?
Uh , yes , I just want you to know that , uh , this is not my decision .
But from here on out , we can no longer be friends .
And when we talk about things here , we must only discuss work associated things .
And you can consider this my retirement from comedy .
And in the future , if I want to say something funny , or witty , or do an impression , I will no longer ever do any of those things .
Does that include , &quot; That &apos;s what she said &quot; ?
Mm-hmm , yes .
Wow , that is really hard .
Do you really think you can go all day long ?
Well , you always left me satisfied and smiling , so ... That &apos;s what she said !
Michael ... Michael !
Michael , please .
There he is !
Mwah !
( Packer ) Come on !
You would have done the same .
You just didn &apos;t think of it first .
Mi-Michael , please .
I-I--really .
That &apos;s not my sense of humor .
Okay .
Hello .
Jan , Mr. O &apos;Malley , this is my lawyer James P. Albini .
I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards .
He specializes in free speech issues .
And motorcycle head injuries , worker &apos;s comp , and diet pill lawsuits .
This guy does it all .
Excuse me , I &apos;m sorry .
Michael , Mr. O &apos;Malley is your lawyer .
What ?
Mr. O &apos;Malley is our corporate lawyer .
We have him on retainer to protect the company , as well as upper level management such as yourself .
So I &apos;m not in trouble ?
I am so used to being the bad boy .
I am so used to fighting corporate that I forget that I am corporate .
Upper management .
They hooked me up with an attorney .
To protect me .
You can &apos;t be too careful about what you say .
Mo &apos; money , mo &apos; problems .
Okay , well , let &apos;s get you out of here , James .
Um , I think we &apos;re under an hour still .
Yeah , but I did a lot of paperwork at home .
We &apos;ll talk about it later .
Thanks for coming in .
Is William Hung here ?
Um , hello .
Oh , my God !
I finally made it .
Hello !
I love my mom .
Okay , that &apos;s probably the most obvious statement ever .
Okay , so when do I get to actually meet all these people ?
Um ... Bear says to the rabbit , &quot; Hey , it stick to your fur ? &quot;
He goes , &quot; No . &quot;
He says , &quot; Good . &quot;
Why don &apos;t we just , like , stay here for a while , and I &apos;ll show you my desk .
Okay .
This is all yours ?
Yeah , I am in charge of this whole area .
Oh , my goodness .
That &apos;s great .
I think we are done with her for a while .
Um , this is my picture of us at Aunt Millie &apos;s barbeque .
The one that you , um ...
Remember the one you said I should get blown up ?
So a guy goes home , tells his wife , &quot; Honey , pack your bags , I just won the lottery . &quot;
She goes , &quot; Oh , my God .
That &apos;s incredible .
Where are we going ? &quot;
He goes , &quot; I don &apos;t know where you &apos;re going , just be out of here by five . &quot;
laughter Boom !
Why does he call her honey if he hates her so much ?
Doesn &apos;t she get half of his money because they &apos;re married ?
It &apos;s a joke , lurch .
This is where I used to keep my computer .
Oh , right , I remember .
With the picture , yeah .
But I switched stuff around because I actually needed , like , more room for organization .
This is , like , um ... Oh , there he is .
How are you ?
Hey , handsome .
You look great .
Oh , thank you .
So , we ready for dinner ?
Well , you know , actually I kind of need to stall a bit .
But it &apos;s okay , because I am very used to killing time .
Oh , I don &apos;t believe that .
Okay , I &apos;m gonna go wait in the parking lot .
And what kind of tunes do you want for the ride ?
A little classical , a little oldies ?
Oh , anything is fine .
All right , well , see ya .
( whispered ) So which one is Jim ?
( whispered ) Mom !
I just wanted to know .
No , it &apos;s ... All right , okay .
minutes , then we can go to dinner .
I &apos;ll make myself busy .
There &apos;s this guy , he &apos;s at a nymphomaniac convention .
And he is psyched , &apos; cause all these woman are smoking hot perfect 10s , except for this one chick who looks a lot like ... Phyllis ?
Yeah .
No , no , no .
That crosses the line .
Ex-squeeze me ?
Not you .
Kevin .
Just unwarranted .
Hostile work environment , Kevin .
Packer said it .
No , you said it .
He pointed .
A point is not a say .
Look , Kevin , we are a family here .
And Phyllis is a valued member of that family .
Like a grandmother .
I &apos;m the same age as you , Michael .
I don &apos;t know about that .
We &apos;re the same high school class .
Well , I have a late birthday and usually September is a cutoff point ... You know what ?
You just crossed the line , okay ?
There is a line and you went over it .
And you must be punished .
So go to your corner .
You mean where my desk is ?
Yes , your corner .
Go .
Okay .
I have a lot of work to do , anyway .
( Packer ) Oh , my .
They really got to you , didn &apos;t they ?
They didn &apos;t get to me .
I got to them .
I am still the same old Michael Scott .
New and improved .
You know what ?
I love Phyllis .
You know what else ?
I think she is gorgeous .
I think she is an incredibly , incredibly attractive person .
Come here .
Give me a kiss .
Come on .
Michael , come on , you don &apos;t have to worry .
I &apos;m not gonna ...
I &apos;m not worried .
report you to HR .
You know what ?
The only thing I am worried about is getting a boner .
Good work today , everybody .
Times have changed a little .
inhales deeply And even though we &apos;re still a family here at Dunder Mifflin , families grow .
And at some point , the daddy can &apos;t take a bath with the kids anymore .
I am upper management .
And it would be inappropriate for me to take a bath with Pam .
As much as I might want to .
He said what ?
Toby actually gets alimony from his ex-wife because she makes more .
So that &apos;s kind of embarrassing .
Not that I &apos;d mind , but it would never happen to me because I would make the marriage work .
People seem to like him because I think he &apos;s one of us , but he &apos;s not .
He &apos;s this weird loner who just tells people , &quot; Don &apos;t do this , don &apos;t do that .
Hire this person for this reason . &quot;
mouths words I would complain about him , but who would I go to to complain about Toby ?
Toby .
Bias .
And what does he do about that ?
Nothing .
Because he &apos;s Toby .
What kind of name is that ?
It &apos;s almost a girl &apos;s name .
I think I &apos;ve known more girls named Toby than guys .
He just kind of makes my skin crawl a little bit .
Toby is the devil .
Toby &apos;s the devil .
So I &apos;m not a big Toby fan .
( Michael ) I &apos;m an early bird , and I &apos;m a night owl .
So I &apos;m wise and I have worms .
Now .
knocking on door Oh !
Breakfast .
I got you your sausage , egg , and cheese biscuit .
Yummy , yummy .
Thank you , Ryan .
What was the thing you needed me to come in early for ?
Um ... the sausage , egg , and cheese biscuit .
But thank you , and why don &apos;t you just ... Take a couple of hours .
Office is yours .
Home Alone , Risky Business .
Take your pants off , run around .
Whatever you wanna do .
I &apos;m just gonna take a nap in my car till work starts .
Okay .
See ?
Healthier .
Gotta watch those carbs .
Hey .
( Jim ) Oh , Pam , can I see you in here for a second ?
It &apos;s important , so ...
Okay .
What ?
What is this ?
I found Dwight &apos;s wallet in the parking lot .
Oh , my God , what are we gonna do ?
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t know what the best play is .
Do we tear everything up , or do we buy a horse on the internet ?
I mean , I don &apos;t know what to do .
What do you think ?
I know .
I know what to do .
Okay , what ?
Okay , put everything back exactly how you found it .
Okay .
Hey , Dwight , Jim and I found your wallet in the parking lot .
What did you do to it ?
Nothing .
I &apos;m serious .
What did you do to it ?
Dwight , I swear , we didn &apos;t do anything .
Nice try .

piano rock Today I , Michael Scott , am becoming a homeowner .
Investing in real estate .
Diversifying .
Smart .
Yes , it is .
Yes , it is .
It is very important to own property .
Back in olden days , they would not even let you vote unless you owned property .
They &apos;d throw you in the stocks and humiliate you .
And it worked .
Yes .
We should bring the stocks back .
People will obey the law .
There &apos;d be less troublemakers .
Maybe .
laughs So what are the specs ?
What ?
What are the specs ?
Oh , okay , I &apos;ll tell you .
Let &apos;s see here .
Three bedroom , two bath contemporary townhouse ... Nice .
Two-car parking ...
Yes .
Wall-to-wall carpet ... God , what a steal !
All fixtures included .
Yes , this is looking good .
Does it have a deck ?
I think it does .
Have you seen it ?
Yes .
Does it have a deck ?
I think it has a--yeah , it has a deck .
They call it a porch , but it is a deck .
When a man is laying on his deathbed , there are four things that go through his mind .
Was I well-loved ?
Check .
Did I express myself ?
Did I let my light shine through ?
Check .
Will an attractive woman cry at my funeral ?
Check--probably more than one .
Check , check , check , check .
Lastly , did I achieve success and own real estate ?
And when I close on this condo , I will be able to check that one as well .
sighs ( Pam ) Every so often , Jim dies of boredom .
I think today it was the expense reports that did him in .
And , uh , our deal is that it &apos;s up to me to revive him .
You see Dwight &apos;s coffee mug ?
Mm-hmm .
Sometimes when he &apos;s not here , I try to throw stuff in it .
No way .
laughs Let &apos;s do this .
crumpling paper Oh !
Here .
Try paper clips .
Oh , wait .
This message .
For Dwight .
Perfect .
Uh !
Oh !
I love it , I love it .
What do you call it ?
Schrute ball .
How about Skeet Schruting ?
Did you just come up with that ?
Mm-hmm .
That is good .
That &apos;s it .
That &apos;s what it is .
Thank you .
Oh , somebody went in .
That was a team effort , Pam .
Oh !
I mean , you &apos;ve got stuff here .
You rented &quot; Mermaids . &quot;
You can &apos;t--it &apos;s a movie .
You can &apos;t deduct that .
You know that .
( Angela ) It &apos;s not an office expense .
Yes , thank you .
Next year you should file your stuff in a basket .
Remember , last year he slipped by with &quot; Stripes . &quot;
He put--he rented &quot; Stripes , &quot; he had it for a week , and that got through , so maybe he &apos;s thinking he can do that from now on .
Please .
Maybe he can file his things in a paper bag .
That &apos;s not helping , Angela .
That &apos;s not helping him .
Homeowner .
About to join an exclusive club , Dwight .
Maybe someday these people out here will know what that feels like .
Maybe not , who knows ?
Not my problem .
You should go .
Yes .
Yes .
Final walkthrough .
Mm-hmm .
Sign the papers at the condo .
You have your lawyer there ?
Uh , I don &apos;t need one .
Can I be your representative ?
I don &apos;t need a representative .
I think I should be there .
No , no .
No , I &apos;m good .
I can make sure things are up to code .
No , Dwight .
I &apos;m fine .
Please ?
I &apos;m always the guy that you rely on at work .
Well , this isn &apos;t about work .
This is closing on a condo .
It &apos;s completely personal .
So you &apos;re taking a personal day ?
clears throat Except that this is about my living arrangement , and as boss , I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work .
Please ?
I &apos;ll make you proud .
Okay , fine .
Yes , you can come .
Yes !
As your representative ?
As my associate .
Same thing .
No , it is not .
Why don &apos;t you bring some work that we can do in the car and some Lunchables as snacks .
Lunchables are a whole lunch .
Just bring it .
I have been Michael &apos;s number two guy for about five years .
And we make a great team .
We &apos;re like one of those classic , famous teams .
He &apos;s like Mozart , and I &apos;m like ... Mozart &apos;s friend .
No .
I &apos;m like Butch Cassidy , and Michael is like Mozart .
You try and hurt Mozart , you &apos;re gonna get a bullet in your head courtesy of Butch Cassidy .
in mocking Asian accent Oh , most honorable Pamera .
Not offensive because that &apos;s the way they talk in movies .
You headed out ?
Uh , we are .
Dwight and I are going to the big thing .
So why don &apos;t you have everybody work on their expense reports , and I &apos;d like them in by the end of the day .
Okay .
Very good .
Have a great time .
We will .
Um , did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines ?
Yeah , I changed them to your new address .
Good .
The ... Small Businessman ?
Yep .
Maxim ?
American Way ?
Cracked ?
Yes .
I changed your Cracked magazine subscription .
How about m--uh , Fine Arts ... Aficionado Monthly ?
No ?
Okay .
Well , could you get on that ?
&apos;Cause I don &apos;t just read Cracked .
sighs Thank you .
Okay .
See you soon .
What is he so excited about ?
Michael &apos;s closing on his condo today .
Ah .
Yesterday he asked me if I &apos;d go with him as his associate .
And you said no ?
Yeah .
He also asked me if I would cry at his funeral .
What kind of shocks you got on this baby ?
I don &apos;t know .
Regular , normal ones .
Nothin &apos; fancy .
Not my style .
What are you doin &apos; ?
I wanna put the top down .
No , Dwight .
It &apos;s 50 degrees outside .
Don &apos;t--Please .
Yeah , but then no one can see us .
I--Just , would you put it up ?
Okay .
Fine .
Just leave it down .
Whiner .
Check it out .
Terminator .
I do not understand what you spend your money on .
Ooh .
( Jim ) Hey , Oscar .
On these new expense reports , do we really have to go back to last quarter ?
Yeah .
It &apos;s a terrible system , I know .
What ?
What does &quot; 2005 season &quot; mean ?
Tha--laughs Wait a minute .
What is this ?
It &apos;s a scoreboard .
What ?
Kevin and I play this paper football game when Michael &apos;s out .
Really ?
Yeah .
Or when we &apos;re bored .
Oh , my God !
Wait , this goes back two years !
We &apos;re bored a lot .
Oh-ho .
Oh !
Sweet .
Yes !
So close .
I really love the , uh , paper triangle flicking and hitting things game .
Yeah .
We call it Hateball .
Why ?
Because of how much Angela hates it .
Hey , do you guys have any other games ?
Sometimes we play Who Can Put the Most m &amp; ms in Their Mouth ?
( Angela ) You play that .
You should ask Toby to teach you Dunderball .
Home sweet home .
Which one &apos;s yours ?
Right there .
My sanctuary .
My party pad .
Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here .
Hang a swing from this tree .
Push &apos; em back-- Wait .
No , it &apos;s this one right here .
Home sweet home .
So it &apos;s like volleyball .
Okay .
Okay , you &apos;re gonna want to take a hold of the ball .
Mm-hmm .
And you bounce it off the wall on your side of the tape .
Oh , okay--oh , so that &apos;s what the tape &apos;s for .
I didn &apos;t know .
Yeah , Michael asked about it once , and I just pretended not to hear him .
He left .
All right , let &apos;s play .
Kelly , do you mind if I use your desk ?
Yeah , go ahead .
Extra points if you break his monitor .
Is that true , Toby ?
It &apos;s not true .
It &apos;s my monitor .
And I &apos;ll just take Kelly &apos;s .
( Kelly ) Nice .
This is all mine .
All the way down , around the corner .
It &apos;s a shared space , but I can use it whenever I want to .
Okay , so I called in a favor to my buddy at the police department ... Ah , the volunteer sheriff &apos;s station .
Same thing .
No .
Um , these are the crime statistics for the surrounding square mile over the past four years .
Oh , anything bad ?
Two charges of loitering .
Mm-hmm .
One noise complaint .
Several speeding tickets .
Mm-hmm .
Do you own a gun ?
No .
I &apos;d think about it .
Mm--I don &apos;t need a gun .
Hello ?
Hello !
How are you ?
Okay .
I &apos;m , uh , just about to close on 126 over there .
And I guess we &apos;re gonna be neighbors .
Very cool .
Very cool .
So , uh--so what &apos;s the vibe ?
What &apos;s the vibe of this place ?
Uh , I don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s pretty quiet .
Oh , rea--wow .
Ooh , that &apos;s gonna change .
laughs Why ?
Because ... I loves to party .
And I &apos;m gonna be partying my butt off at this place .
Okay , but there &apos;s an 11 : 00 noise curfew .
Hi , I &apos;m Dwight Schrute , Mr. Scott &apos;s associate .
Who &apos;s Mr. Scott ?
Him .
I have a question about the property line .
These two trees are pretty close together , but it looks to me like this one &apos;s more on your side , this one might be more on his .
Yeah .
What are you doing home in the middle of the day ?
I just came back for lunch .
What are you having ?
Like a Hot Pocket .
What line of business are you in ?
I &apos;m a salesman .
( Dwight ) Really ?
So am I. Yeah ?
What ?
I sell yarn .
You &apos;re a yarn salesman ?
Yeah .
I have a couple questions about the neighborhood .
Have you had any problems with prostitution , crack dealing , gang violence , etcetera ?
groans No .
Here &apos;s a question for you .
I have a convertible .
Is it safe to park that in my driveway ?
All right , see you soon .
A good guy .
Um ... cool .
So that &apos;s what this sound is all day .
laughter I think I &apos;m going to make myself some microwave popcorn .
humming La , la , da-da Press Popcorn .
Oh , that &apos;s gonna be delicious .
I just love having popcorn in the middle of the afternoon .
You know what ?
I could do with some hot chocolate as well .
Oh , drat , I can &apos;t make hot chocolate and popcorn at the same time , unless I can !
Boom , second microwave for &quot; le hot chocolate &quot; !
Hello , hello , hi .
Oh , Carol , hi , how are you ?
Hey , Michael .
Good to see you .
Uh , Michael , this is Bill .
He &apos;s the head of the Condo Association .
Oh !
Hey , how are you ?
Nice to meet you , Bill .
Bill .
Mr. Bill .
( as Mr. Bill ) Oh , no !
Mr. Bill !
Whoa !
Ho-Ho !
SNL ?
When they pull him apart ?
He would always get rolled over by something .
N-Nice to meet you .
Nice to meet you too .
This is smaller than your old place .
Yes , well , I &apos;m buying it and I &apos;m not renting it .
So it &apos;s still an upgrade .
He doesn &apos;t know anything about property ownership .
He &apos;s kind of an idiot .
Um ... ( Dwight ) Actually , I do own property .
My grandfather left me a 60-acre working beet farm .
I run it with my cousin Mose .
We sell beets to local stores and restaurants .
It &apos;s a nice little farm .
Sometimes teenagers use it for sex .
Are we ready to sign some papers ?
Actually , no .
We have a couple of questions , uh , about the neighborhood .
I-It &apos;s very safe .
It &apos;s very clean .
Uh , also , it &apos;s very accepting of all lifestyles .
It &apos;s a very gay-friendly neighborhood .
Oh , good .
That &apos;s good .
It &apos;s good to be accommodating of ... that .
Let &apos;s go check out the master bedroom .
Hey , Phyllis .
Do you have any games that you play in the office ?
What do you mean ?
You know , like , little time killer games , like stapler tennis or something like that .
No .
Okay .
Stanley .
I just played Dunderball with Toby .
What about you ?
You got any games ?
Yeah , I got a game .
It &apos;s called Work Hard So My Kids Can Go To College .
Fair enough .
This , my friends , is the master bedroom .
Check out the cathedral ceilings .
Those are , like , feet high .
We have cable readiness right there .
I am going to totally pimp this place out .
I am going to put a surround sound system .
I am going to put a plasma screen right against this wall .
Ooh , terrible idea .
&apos;Cause I &apos;m putting my bed right over here .
No , no , no , no , no .
This is a shared wall .
Neighbor throws his wife into the wall , plasma screen hits the floor , totally smashed .
Well , then I will get a warranty .
Warranties don &apos;t cover it .
Plus , they &apos;re a rip-off .
Well , then I won &apos;t get a warranty .
Christina !
Shh !
So , that &apos;s the problem .
It &apos;s solved .
What ?
I don &apos;t hear you practicing .
Can you hear that ?
cello playing Oh , man !
These babies are thin !
singing Olympic Anthem This scented candle imitating echo --andle , --andle ...
Which I found in the men &apos;s bathroom , room , room ...
Represents the eternal ... burning of competition or something .
It smells like cookies .
Yes , it does .
Yes , it does , my friend .
Okay , we will be competing for gold , silver , and bronze yogurt lids .
Now , the bronze are really blue .
And they &apos;re also the backside of the gold , so no flipping .
Okay ?
Honor system .
( Angela ) I do play games .
I sing .
And I dangle things in front of my cats .
I play lots of games .
Just not at work .
Let the games begin .
applause all singing Olympic Anthem Second bedroom , whoop !
For the ladies !
I mean , the extra ladies who aren &apos;t in my bed or for friends and family , whoever wants to pop on by to casa de Scott , and right in here , what &apos;s in here ?
Uh-oh , bedroom number three .
What are we gonna do in there ?
Limitless possibilities .
( Dwight ) Seal it off !
What ?
What are you doing in there ?
Fill it full of cotton or soundproof insulation .
Oh , my God , Dwight !
Seal it off with drywall so you don &apos;t hear Yo-Yo Ma over there .
Oh , you know what I might do is I might make this into a kid &apos;s room .
Kids , you don &apos;t even have a girlfriend .
I will have a girlfriend once she sees this place .
I &apos;m gonna get married , and I &apos;m going to have kids .
( Dwight ) Well , that depends on how old she is .
What if your girlfriend is 55 ?
I &apos;m not gonna date a 55-year-old woman .
Just a possibility .
No , it &apos;s not , just shut up !
If you fall in love with her .
You &apos;re an ass , shut it !
I smell mold .
No , you don &apos;t .
Stop .
Living on a farm , your sense of smell gets very sharp .
For example , there are beets in a condo two doors down that way , and ... someone over there I believe is a big fan of olives .
And then I just need you to sign here at this arrow .
What kind of mortgage did you get ?
Uh , 10-year .
Well , 10 over 30 , so 30-year total .
What ?
Wha-- You said 10 .
S-- 10-year fixed ... over 30 .
30-year total .
Huh .
30 years .
Okay , okay , okay .
Wow , you &apos;ll be payin &apos; this off in your mid 70s .
All right .
chuckles Forget about retiring when you &apos;re 65. exhaling Hey , I &apos;ve got an idea .
You know that extra bedroom ?
If the whole girlfriend thing never happens , that &apos;s where the nurse can live .
Okay , all right .
Oh , boy .
Well , this is it .
Whenever you &apos;re ready .
Yeah .
Um ... that &apos;s news to me , the whole 30 years thing .
I think I was pretty clear about that , Michael .
Moment of reckoning .
It &apos;s pretty standard .
All right , it &apos;s not the moment of reckoning .
Just stop it .
This is not it .
This is--this-- there &apos;s a lot more .
( Dwight ) What is this if this isn &apos;t it ?
Ho .
Ho-okay .
Is that supposed to come off ?
Actually , yes .
Hey , look , cool .
Carpenter ants .
Um ... Gonna take a little , uh , breather for a second .
Excuse me .
It &apos;ll be here waiting for you .
Oh , man .
( Dwight ) A 30-year mortgage at Michael &apos;s age essentially means that he &apos;s buying a coffin .
If I were buying my coffin , I would get one with thicker walls so you couldn &apos;t hear the other dead people .
cello playing breathing heavily Oh !
Whenever you &apos;re ready , Michael .
Ugh !
No , this isn &apos;t it .
Not by a longshot .
You have what is the national sport of Icelandic paper companies .
And I &apos;m blanking on the name .
Could you help me out , Pam ?
Jim , they refer to it as ... Flonkerton .
( Jim ) Hmm .
( Pam ) In English , Box of Paper Snowshoe Racing .
Fair enough , but I like Flonkerton .
The thing about Jim is , when he &apos;s excited about something , like the office Olympics , he gets really into it and he does a really great job .
But the problem with Jim is that he works here , so that hardly ever happens .
So who will be challenging Kevin in Flonkerton ?
Anyone ?
I &apos;ll do it .
Yes !
Phyllis !
applause Phyllis , if you &apos;d just put your foot right through here .
Right through the flonk .
I &apos;m gonna back out of the deal .
Nothing personal , but I feel like I have been taken advantage of here .
How ?
sniffs This smells of fraud to me .
This whole thing just kind of stinks .
The ceilings are lower than they were last week .
That--I don &apos;t-- What ?
I don &apos;t know if you showed me this same unit or not .
Where-- Michael , this is the unit you saw , and-- Where are all the hot people ?
I was told that there would be all these attractive singles .
Who told you that ?
And as far as I can tell , I &apos;m the best-looking person here .
( Michael ) There &apos;s a basic principle in real estate that you should never be the best-looking person in the development .
It &apos;s just sorta common sense , because if you are , then you have no place to go but down .
Is this a financial thing ?
If it &apos;s financial thing , what some people do is , they rent out the third bedroom .
No , no .
No , no , no , no .
And that &apos;s some extra income for you .
I am not going to rent the third bedroom .
I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin &apos; .
You will lose $ 7,000 if you walk away right now .
Muh ... Mmm , mmm , mmm .
Cugino &apos;s , what a great bread .
I made the right decision .
I &apos;m glad I signed .
The--I &apos;m a homeowner .
Right ?
Good to be a homeowner .
Diversifying .
This is good .
This is fun .
We &apos;re havin &apos; fun .
Totally havin &apos; fun .
Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today ?
both laughing ( Jim ) Here we go .
Here we go .
cheering Dig deep .
Dig deep !
screaming Oh !
It &apos;s Phyllis !
It &apos;s Phyllis .
( Jim ) Phyllis by a nose .
Gold medal in Flurnenton .
Flonkerton !
( Jim ) Thank you , delegate from Iceland .
( Jim ) Wow .
Okay .
No one else should even try .
Gold medals .
cheering Give him medals .
Wow !
cheers and applause Ahh , so want to head back ?
Yes .
Oh , and ... there &apos;s somethin &apos; else , Dwight , wanted to talk to you about .
I have a surprise for you .
For helpin &apos; me out today .
Oh , you didn &apos;t have to do-- No .
No .
I insist , I insist .
Because you &apos;ve really done some great work .
Great work !
And that is why I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent .
gasps Why did I do it ?
Because I believe in rewarding people for their efforts .
Uh , I rewarded Dwight with the room , and he is rewarding me back with , uh , $ 500 plus utilities .
Let &apos;s just take a moment though and make sure that this is the right fit for you .
Why are you even saying that ?
You don &apos;t have enough money .
Here &apos;s how we &apos;ll remedy that .
I can give you a raise .
And then we can have Dunder Mifflin just pay for it .
That &apos;s not unethical because Dwight does excellent work , and he &apos;s earned it .
Thank you .
I guess my philosophy about Dwight would be this : If you can teach a man , Dwight , to fish , room , then he will learn , pay $ 500 in rent , how to fish , plus utilities .
I don &apos;t even know what to say .
I &apos;m thinkin &apos; , lock into a four-year commitment .
We &apos;ll go month-to-month after that .
Or until I start dating , have a girlfriend .
And then you &apos;re , you know , you &apos;re gone , so ...
Question : Where can I put my terrarium ?
What hell is a terrarium ?
It &apos;s a fish tank for snakes and lizards .
Oh , so , an aquarium ?
Uh , that ... will not come into this place .
Okay ?
Question : Oh , my God .
My grandparents left me a large number of armoires .
Tell you what , the deal will be off the table in ten minutes , so take it or leave it .
I &apos;ve got a lot of work to do .
Oh , boy .
This whole condo &apos;s shifting .
It &apos;s like this place was built on an ancient Indian burial ground .
( Pam ) Are you sure you don &apos;t wanna play ?
( Angela ) I &apos;m sure .
Come on , Angela .
Don &apos;t you have a game ?
I have one , yes .
Well , let &apos;s play .
What is it ?
I call it Pam Pong .
I count how many times Jim gets up from his desk and goes to reception to talk to you .
We &apos;re friends .
Apparently .
( Jim ) Very nicely done .
Okay , so , think that &apos;s H-O-R for Stanley and H-O for Phyllis .
Are you calling me a ho ?
Oh , my God .
Phyllis coming alive .
I like it .
Are you calling me a whore ?
Stanley !
That is inappropriate , okay ?
We just need to stop .
Everybody , let &apos;s get involved .
There are medals to be won here .
Here we go .
Question : What about carpooling ?
Uh , who pays for the gas ?
We take separate cars .
Then question : Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine ?
( Michael ) Why would we do that ?
Just for fun ?
No .
Question : Who &apos;s the primary on the fire insurance ?
imitating hockey air horn Game over !
Offer revoked , Dwight .
I &apos;m sorry , but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy and help out a friend , and this is what happens .
This is what I get .
I--God .
I &apos;m--Okay .
Ooh .
( Dwight ) Thank God .
It was nice of him to offer .
But I live in a nine-bedroom farmhouse .
I have my own crossbow range .
It &apos;s a perfect situation for me .
Although two bathrooms would have been nice .
We just have the one .
And it &apos;s under the porch .
elevator dings Ah !
Oh !
Who had somebody from Vance Refrigeration ?
Ryan Howard .
cheering Ryan .
Gold medal .
I made something for our closing ceremonies .
What ?
Oh , my God !
Where &apos;d you have time to make that ?
Automatic voice mail .
All right , Pam .
All right .
laughs Nice work .
You know you can always refinance your mortgage .
We had a 15-year on our beet farm .
We paid it off early .
Yeah , well , you know what ?
Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm .
Beets are the worst .
People love beets .
Nobody likes beets .
Everyone loves beets .
Nobody likes beets , Dwight !
Why don &apos;t you grow something that everybody does like ?
You should grow candy .
I &apos;d love a piece of candy right now .
Not a beet .
Let &apos;s get this roof goin &apos; .
Stop it !
Ow !
Final lap !
Final lap !
( man ) Oscar !
( Jim ) Time to beat is 1 : 15 .
Time to beat is one minute , seconds .
Here they come !
cheering and urging Guys ?
( Dwight ) What is going on ?
Nothing .
Guys ?
Timer still goin &apos; ?
Or-- That &apos;s my stopwatch .
Hey .
That was fun today .
Sorry we didn &apos;t get to the closing ceremonies .
Yeah .
Thanks .
What ... the hell ?
There you go .
All done .
Great .
( Jim ) Yeah , I filled out the expense reports .
That took about five minutes .
And then I closed two sales at lunchtime .
So ... about as productive as any other day .
If not more so .
( Ryan ) I figured I could throw it away now , or I could keep it for a couple of months and then throw it away .
I mean , it was really nice of Pam to make them , but what am I gonna do with a gold medal made of paper clips and an old yogurt lid ?
Hey , Dwight .
Want to play a game ?
No .
What kind of game ?
I don &apos;t know .
Let &apos;s make one up .
Oh , and you can use your weird rubber band ball if you want .
To do what ?
I don &apos;t know , um ... oh , you know what ?
Okay , I &apos;ll set up these pencils , and then you try to knock them down .
It &apos;ll be like desk bowling or something like that .
I &apos;m really not in the mood for games today , Jim .
Hey .
I have 59 voice mails .
Mm .
Hey , can you ignore those and do something for me instead ?
Sure .
Okay .
Today , 5 : 00 ... closing ceremonies .
Really ?
Notify the athletes .
Cool .
knocking on door Michael .
Yeah ?
Jim .
Slim Jim .
What &apos;s goin &apos; --What &apos;s goin &apos; on ?
Nothin &apos; .
I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo .
Oh , thanks .
Thanks .
It &apos;s very cool .
It &apos;s , uh , three bedroom , gay-friendly .
Nice .
You know .
Hey , would you mind comin &apos; out here for a second ?
I just have something for you .
Really ?
What &apos;s this ?
There are the closing ceremonies .
Step up .
W--Um ... You &apos;re on the top one .
Congratulations to Michael because he closed on his condo .
So gold medal .
applause I don &apos;t really know what to say .
Um ...
I &apos;m not one for making speeches , but , uh ... my heart is very full at this moment .
applause And for Dwight Schrute , the silver medal .
( Michael ) Get on up here , Dwight .
Silver medal .
Yep .
Not as good as gold .
Star-Spangled Bannerplays Why are you playing the national anthem ?
Um , &apos; cause your condo &apos;s in America .
Oh .
What the hell is that ?
Those are the doves .
applause cheering ( man ) All right !
phone rings - Dunder Mifflin , this is Pam .
Sure , can I ask who &apos;s calling ?
Just a second .
phone rings - Jim Halpert .
What ?
How did you get this number ?
Stalker .
- Katie and Jim met in the office .
And now I guess they &apos;re , like , going out or dating or something .
And , uh ...
I don &apos;t know , you know ?
They &apos;re just--she calls him and they ... you know .
I &apos;m sorry , I feel like I &apos;m talking really loud .
Am I talking really loud ?
- Katie and I have been out a few times .
I wouldn &apos;t call her my girlfriend , but , yeah , I like her a lot .
She makes me laugh , which I think is really hard to find .
I mean , Dwight makes me laugh , too , of course .
But Katie &apos;s a little cuter .
So we &apos;re still on for lunch ?
You &apos;re meeting me here ?
Okay .
Great .
Bye .
- Hey , you can just give her your extension .
- Okay .

That &apos;s not ac-- &quot; accplicable . &quot;
- Michael &apos;s in there right now evaluating the temp .
He hasn &apos;t evaluated me in years .
- Attitude .
Needs improvement .
- How can I improve that ?
- Better already .
To be a boss , a good boss , you have to have the ability to recognize talent .
Including your own .
And one of mine , one of my talents , is being a mentor .
And , not kinda the stuffy professor guy , but s--fun .
Somebody fun .
And practical .
But fun .
But respected .
And loved .
Five years from now , what do you wanna do ?
Where do you wanna be ?
- Uh , well , I &apos;m interested in business .
- Oh , good , ambitious .
Excellent .
Wanna be a manager ?
- Uh , no , actually what I want is to own my own company .
- That is ridiculous .

I &apos;m like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda rolled into one .
as Yoda Much advice you seek .
Do you know who that is ?

69. restrained chuckle 70 , 71 , 72 , 73 .
There are ten rules of business that you need to learn .
Number one : you need to play to win ... but ... you also have to win to play .
- Got it .
- And I will give you the-- the rest of the ten at lunch .
Very nice .
Hey .
clicks tongue - Michael and I have a very special connection .
He &apos;s like Batman , I &apos;m like Robin .
He &apos;s like The Lone Ranger , and I &apos;m like Tonto .
And it &apos;s not like there was The Lone Ranger and Tonto and Bonto .
Hey , how &apos;s it going , man ?
- Good .
What &apos;s up ?
- Oh , nothing much .
What &apos;s up with you ?

Good , I &apos;m good , too .
Well , how &apos;s it crackin &apos; ?
- Uh , fine .
What &apos;s up ?
- You know what you would love ?
Guns N &apos; Roses .
When I was your age , I loved Guns N &apos; Roses .
Do you like Guns N &apos; Roses ?
- Uh-- - I &apos;ll make you a tape .
- Cool .
- I &apos;ll make you two tapes .
- I don &apos;t have a tape player .
So-- - chuckles Someday , temp .
I &apos;ve got a couple of shirts that don &apos;t fit so well anymore .
I &apos;ll bring &apos; em by .
Okay !
- Rule three , reach for the stars .
And if you fail , see rule four .
Rule four , failure is not an option .
- Got it .
Ryan is gonna love these .
- Yes , yes , yes , yes , yes !
And at the end , I will reveal that they were all just one rule .
- That is so cool .
- Mm-hmm .
- Plus you can go &quot; Rule five ?
See rule six .
&quot; Rule six ?
See rule five . &quot;
- No , I &apos;m not trying to trick him , I &apos;m trying to be a good mentor .
So-- - Kill or be killed .
- Mm , no .
- Shoot to kill .
Or , kill to shoot .
- No , come on , Dwight .
I have to have ten of these by lunch .
I promised Ryan .
- Just ask for an extension .
- I &apos;m not asking the temp for an extension .
Unless I really need it .
- Michael and I have a very special connection , like an umbilical cord .
And the thing is , with Ryan , is I don &apos;t want him to trip on it or ... get it caught around his neck .
fire alarm ringing People !
- Okay !
Everybody ?
- This is not a test .
Move to the exits .

Get up off your desks !

- Do not panic !
- Let &apos;s go people !
No , panic is warranted !
- Single file line .
- This is not a drill !
- Arms at your side !
Arms at your side !
- Please , move quickly .
This is a paper company , people !
Step lively !
This whole place is a tinderbox .
It is ready to blow .
This is not a test !
Can you leave ?
- Oh , you say that every time .
- Do you wanna die ? !
- Oh , boy .

Breathe through your nose .
Remove your stockings !
Okay ?
They &apos;ll melt right into your flesh !
Stay below the smoke line .
Let &apos;s go !
Clear out , stat !
&quot; Stat &quot; means now !
- Yes , I was the first one out .
A captain is always the first one on the ship and the last one off the ship .
And ... this parking lot is our ship when the building is on fire .
So ...
I ran out onto the ship .
And , yes , I &apos;ve heard &quot; women and children first . &quot;
But we do not employ children .
We are not a sweatshop , thankfully .
And women are equal in the workplace by law .
So , I let them out first , I have a lawsuit on my hands .
Another rule of business is being able to adapt to different situations .
- Yeah ?
- Adapt , react , readapt ...
Apt .
Right ?
That &apos;s rule number two .
- Okay , guys , listen up .
We need a headcount .
We need to count off .
Michael &apos;s number one .
Where is he ?
Where is he ?
- So what was rule two ?
- Uh , adapt , react , readapt , apt .
- Okay , well , let &apos;s just kinda take it a little slower .

- Okay--uh , sorry .
- Okay , he can have 14 .
Margery &apos;s not here today .

- Oh , you know what else ?
I thought of a nickname for the three of us .
Three musketeers .
- Um , yeah , okay .
That--no , no , no , no !
I got one , I got one .
The three stooges .
- That &apos;s funny , too .
But if we &apos;re the three musketeers ... - I don &apos;t wanna be , like , a guy here , you know ?
Like , Stanley is the crossword puzzle guy .
And Angela has cats .
I don &apos;t wanna have a thing here , you know ?
I don &apos;t wanna be the something guy .
- Okay , you know what ?
I think I &apos;m gonna be setting the agenda here , okay ?
Everybody gather up , please .
Important announcement .
Very important announcement .
I think this is a perfect opportunity for all of us to participate in some really intense , psychologically revealing conversations .
So we &apos;re gonna be playing Desert Island , um , &quot; Who Would You Do ? &quot;
And , um ... - &quot; Would You Rather ? &quot;
- &quot; Would You Rather ? &quot;
&quot; Would You Rather ? &quot;

fire truck horn siren blares - Yeah !
Hey , guys , great response time .
Listen up .
I got some theories .
Okay , there &apos;s a ...
I &apos;m a safety officer .
I &apos;m a volunteer sheriff &apos;s deputy .
And I know that when there &apos;s a dangerous situation-- look , I have been training my whole life for this .
There may be fire inside the walls right now .
- Yes , there is a real fire .
But it &apos;s okay .
Everyone got out fine .
This is why you practice these things .
- I like fire drills .
You know what &apos;s the greatest ?
Like , when you were in school and the teacher would let you have class outside .
- Oh , the best .
- Yeah , it was great because it was like you &apos;re supposed to be working , but nothing ever gets done .
- Yeah , we had outside classes all the time and we never did anything .
- laughs - Actually , if I had had fewer outside classes , I probably wouldn &apos;t be stuck here at a paper company .
- You &apos;re not stuck .
- Okay , so , three books on a desert island .
Angela .
- The Bible .
- That &apos;s one book .
You &apos;ve got two others .
- Uh , &quot; Purpose Driven Life . &quot;
- Nice .
Third book .
- No .
- Okay , Phyllis .
- Um , &quot; The Da Vinci Code . &quot;
- &quot; The Da Vinci Code . &quot;
I would take &quot; The Da Vinci Code &quot; so I could burn &quot; The Da Vinci Code . &quot;
- Okay , great , that &apos;s gonna keep you warm for , like , seven seconds .
Question , is there firewood on the island ?
- I guess .
- Then I would bring an axe , no books .
- No , it has to be a book , Dwight .
- Fine , &quot; Physician &apos;s Desk Reference . &quot;
- Nice , smart .
- Hollowed out .
Inside , waterproof matches , iodine tablets .
Beet seeds , protein bars , NASA blanket .
And ... in case I get bored , &quot; Harry Potter and the Sorcerer &apos;s Stone . &quot;
No , &quot; Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . &quot;
Question , did my shoes come off in the plane crash ?
- Plane crash ?
- This is important .
Leather is a food source .
- No , it &apos;s not .
- Leather from shoes can be boiled down to a simple broth that can sustain a man for over two weeks .
- You just made that up .
- Question , are there animals on the island ?
- Rule number four .
&quot; In business , image is everything . &quot;
Andre Agassi .
This car is an investment , right ?
If I have to take out a client .
Or I &apos;m seen around Scranton in it .
I love it .
I love this car .
Do you like it ?

DVDs .
Five movies .
What would you bring to the island ?
Toby , go ahead .
- Um , &quot; Say Anything , &quot; &quot; The Shining . &quot;
Uh , &quot; Annie Hall . &quot;
That &apos;s too obvious .
- Those are like my favorite movies .
I didn &apos;t really think you could win Desert Island , but I think you just did .
- Oh , &quot; Toy Story 2 . &quot;
One of the best movies I ever saw .
I went for my daughter .
And stayed because you can &apos;t leave your daughter in a theater .
- Toby and I used to sit together .
Until Michael moved us because he thought we talked too much .
- Really ?
- Yeah .
- Can I go next ?
- Yes , Meredith .
- &quot; Legends of the Fall , &quot; &quot; My Big Fat Greek Wedding , &quot; &quot; Legally Blonde , &quot; &quot; Bridges of Madison County . &quot;
- Wow .
&quot; Legends of the Fall . &quot;
- Wow .
&quot; Bridges of Madison County , &quot; &quot; Legally Blonde . &quot;
These movies are just-- - Well , I kind of like ... - Wait , wait , wait .
Pam , no .
Do you understand ?
The game is desert island movies , not guilty pleasure movies .
Desert island movies are the movies you &apos;re gonna watch for the rest of your life !
Forever !
Unforgivable .
- I take it back .
- Unforgivable .
- I take it back !
- Good .
- And &quot; Ghost . &quot;
But , uh , just that one scene .
You know that scene ?
- Yeah , yes .
- Yeah , I know that scene .
- That was a good scene .
Um , Kevin .
Do it .
- Uh , &quot; Cannonball Run , &quot; &quot; Cannonball Run 2 , &quot; &quot; Weekend-- &quot; snickers &quot; Weekend at Bernie &apos;s , &quot; &quot; Weekend at Bernie &apos;s 2 , &quot; and--ooh , &quot; Groundhog Day . &quot;
- &quot; Groundhog Day . &quot;
- I have a client who watches that movie once a week at least .
- Really ?
- I should put you in touch with him .
Maybe we could get together and work on that account ?
- I would love that .
- Okay , guys , guys , guys .
That almost sounded like business , and we are trying to focus here today , okay ?
- Is this your car , Ryan ?
- Wow , some pretty big books back there , huh ?
- Don &apos;t .
- Good shocks .
- Hello , Mr. Egghead .
Beep !
I &apos;m just kidding .
I read a lot .
Lot of , uh , lot of suspense thrillers , lot of business books .
- Yeah .
- Funny story , I got this book &quot; Who Moved My Cheese ? &quot;
It &apos;s a great business book .
- Right .
- But I bought it because I thought it was a suspense thriller .
Oh , Stanley Kaplan , I know him .
&quot; M is for Murder , &quot; &quot; P is for-- &quot; - That &apos;s actually a test prep book .
- &quot; for Phone . &quot;
What ?
- That &apos;s a test prep for business school .
- Oh , thinking about business school .
- I just got in .
I applied .
I go at night .
- Really ?
So , you think you know a lot about business ?
- No , not yet .
Just started .
- Uh-huh , yeah .
Quiz me .
- I wouldn &apos;t even know-- - Oh , come on .
Come on , Egghead .
Let &apos;s do it .
- Do it .
- Quiz me up .
- All right , um ... Why have people been rethinking the Microsoft model in the past few years ?
- When I was Ryan &apos;s age , I worked in a fast food restaurant to save up money for school .
And then I lost it in a pyramid scheme .
But I learned more about business right then and there than business school would ever teach me or Ryan would ever teach me .
- When the dollar goes up , what does that do to American business ?
- Pass .
- Up .
- Um , right .
- Pass .
- When I was Ryan &apos;s age , I worked selling cutlery for a while .
Cutlery that could decimate a penny , I kid you not .
There were these shears that could cut straight through a penny .
So , I have life experience and work experience that Ryan doesn &apos;t and will never have .
- Is it cheaper to sign a new customer or to keep an existing customer ?
- Keep an existing-- - Shut ... it .
Can I just do it please ?
Uh , it &apos;s equal .
- It is ten times more expensive to sign a new customer .
- Okay , yes .
It was a trick question .
- Yeah , but look .
I mean , he didn &apos;t need business school , okay ?
Michael comes from the school of hard knocks .
- Okay , Dwight ?
- Self-taught .
You didn &apos;t even go to college .
- You know what ?
You don &apos;t need to help me here , okay ?
You know , maybe you should go to business school like Ryan .
Then you &apos;d know what you &apos;re talking about .
- Come on , I &apos;m studying with a master , huh ?
You should learn from him , right ?
Right ?
- Stop , Dwight .
You know what , Dwight ?
You &apos;re acting like a dork .
Would you cool it , please ?
- grunts Okay .
- Ooh !
Hey , he &apos;s not your five-year-old brother , Dwight .
He &apos;s a valued member of this company .
- No , I-- And you know what ?
He knows more about business than you ever will .
- Stupid .
- I did not go to business school .
You know who else didn &apos;t go to business school ?
LeBron James , Tracy McGrady .
Kobe Bryant .
They went right from high school to the NBA .
So ... so it &apos;s not the same thing at all .
Look at this stuff .
Market fragments .
What is that supposed to be ?
It &apos;s a way of looking at consumers as subsets of a larger client base .
- Do you have a pen ?
- Uh , not on me .
Here , um , two shoe salesmen go into the jungle , okay ?
- Yeah .
- On the first day , they realize no one in the jungle wears shoes .
- All right .
- So the first salesman calls his boss , says , &quot; Nobody wears shoes .
Get me out of here . &quot;
- I &apos;m a boss .
I , uh , I say , &quot; Okay , but first you have to reimburse me for your travel-- &quot; - No , you &apos;re the second salesman .
You say , &quot; Nobody down here wears shoes .
It &apos;s a totally untapped market . &quot;
- You are so smart .
You are so F-ing smart .
You should be teaching me .
Well , I &apos;m smart enough to know what I don &apos;t know .
Which is apparently everything .
- Pam , get us back into it .
Five movies , go ahead .
- Okay , um , &quot; Fargo . &quot;
Um , &quot; Edward Scissorhands , &quot; &quot; Dazed and Confused . &quot;
- Ooh , definitely in my top five .
- Yes , in my top three , so suck it .
&quot; Breakfast Club . &quot;
Um , &quot; The Princess Bride . &quot;
- Okay , that &apos;s five .
loud snapping - No , my all-time favorite !
- Pam , play by the rules .
- All-time favorite .
Play by the rules .
Dwight .
All-time favorite movie .
- &quot; The Crow . &quot;
engine revving tires squealing - I became a salesman because of people .
I love making friends .
But then I was promoted to manager at a very young age .
And I still try to be a friend first .
But , you know ...
When you &apos;re very successful , your co-workers look at you differently .
sighs What do you think ?
- Maybe we should get some air .
- No , I &apos;m okay .
- I &apos;m really uncomfortable .
- All right , let &apos;s move on .
Let &apos;s move on to the main event .
Who would you do ?
- Present company excluded ?
- Um , not necessarily .
- Pam .
- Pam .
- Um ...
Okay , uh , you know what ?
Maybe I &apos;ll-- I &apos;ll finish explaining the rules .
Let me explain it first and then ... - Think you &apos;ve had too much - Yeah , so we &apos;ll get right-- you know what ?
I &apos;ll be right back .
Stanley , you &apos;re taking over for me , buddy .
I &apos;ll be right back .
- Okay , um ... &quot; Everybody Hurts &quot; by R.E.M.
continues - Dwight .
- Everybody hurts music plays louder - Dwight .
Come on , Dwight , use words .
- Sometimes-- - Why didn &apos;t I go to business school ?
- Who goes to business school ?
- The temp .
- He does ?
- Yeah , it &apos;s all him and Michael talk about anymore .
- You know , I bet Ryan thinks to himself , &quot; I wish I were a volunteer sheriff on the weekend . &quot;
- He doesn &apos;t even know that I do that .
- You should tell him .
- Oh , yeah , Pam , right .
That &apos;s gonna help things , just talk it out .
I hope the war goes on forever and Ryan gets drafted .
- Dwight .
- What ?
- I &apos;m sorry I said that .
I didn &apos;t-- just part of me meant it .
Besides , he &apos;d end up being a hero , anyway .
- You know what you should do ?
You should quit .
And then , that would stick it to both of them .
- No , Jim , I &apos;m not gonna quit .
Then Ryan wins .
- Yeah , you &apos;re right .
- Thanks , you guys .
I just need some alone time .
- Okay .
- All right , buddy .
- Everybody cries ... both laugh - Hey .
Guys , what &apos;s going on ?
- Hey .
- Nothin &apos; .

- Everyone , okay .

Because some smart , sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing !
laughing - Oh , wow !
Okay .
Well , I guess they don &apos;t teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school-- - That &apos;s exactly what I said !

He &apos;s one , I &apos;m two .
He &apos;s alpha , I &apos;m beta .
He &apos;s A , I &apos;m B.
It &apos;s easy .
Whatever Michael is , I &apos;m one less .
I am Michael &apos;s right-hand man .
And he doesn &apos;t need another right-hand man because he &apos;s only got one right arm .
I know Michael &apos;s every move .
It &apos;s not something you can just pick up .
I could write a book about him .
Literally .
I started one once , but Michael made me stop .
- If I could change the life of one person , just one person , I--actually , that &apos;s shooting kinda low .
I already did that .
When I was born .
Changed two people &apos;s lives .
Mom and Dad .
Um ... if I could change the lives of 5,000 people , 10,000 , nah , five .
I &apos;d be satisfied with 5,000 .
I--10,000 though , that &apos;d be something .
Wow , 10,000 people .
Because you know what ?
Even one is amazing .
door closes Where is my desk ?
That is weird .
This is not funny .
This is totally unprofessional .
Okay .
Well , you &apos;re the one who lost the desk .
I didn &apos;t lose my desk .
Okay , calm down .
Where was the last place you saw it ?
Okay , who moved my desk ?
I think you should retrace your steps .
Okay , I am going to tell Michael , and this entire office will be punished .
Colder .
Warmer .
Little warmer .
There you go .
Ooh , warmer .

phone ringing Dwight Schrute .
Hi , Dwight .
Um , what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 pound white ?
Jim , I &apos;ve given you this information , like , 20 times .
I know .
toilet flushes It &apos;s by the ream ?
Uh , yeah .
It is now 9.78 .
So it &apos;s a discount of 7 % .
Okay , thank you .
Gotta get back to work .
Wash your hands , Kevin .
upbeat music Right .
Oh , well , let me just check the pricing list .
Hold on one second .
Sensei .
Hello , it &apos;s sempai .
Dwight .
You know what , let me give you a call right back .
I &apos;m going to find it and then I &apos;ll call you back .
Thanks .
Yes , I just had a ques-- Yes , sensei .
Arigato gozaimashita .
Hai .
Was that your mom ?
No .
That was my sensei .
Oh , thought it was your mom .
I am now sempai , which is assistant sensei .
Assistant to the sensei , that &apos;s pretty cool .
Assistant sensei .
Okay .
I am a practitioner of Goju-Ryu Karate here in Scranton .
( all ) Huh !
2 .
( all ) Huh !
Dwight , stamp and kick back .
3 .
( all ) Huh !
My sensei , Ira , recently promoted me to purple belt and gave me the duties of a sempai .
Not that a lot of people here in America know what a sempai is .
But it &apos;s equally as respected as a sensei .
Huh !
Great .
Huh !
Excellent .
Huh !
That &apos;s okay .
Huh !
Good .
Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
Hold on , hold on .
pager beeping Sorry , just one sec-- Dwight-- Dwight , you can &apos;t use your pager in here , I told you .
Okay , it &apos;s just-- it &apos;s a sales call .
Dwight , ten push-ups .
Ten push-ups !
I can-- Yes , sensei !
Go !
One , two .
And snap , okay ?
Now , Dwight got hurt last week , all right ?
It &apos;s because we didn &apos;t pull our kicks back .
When we fight in-class , we don &apos;t fight full-contact .
From now on , not full-contact with Dwight , okay ?
( Dwight ) Do I feel bad that I haven &apos;t bonded with the other students ?
No , I &apos;m not there to make friends .
I &apos;m there to attack people .
I don &apos;t want to stay until 7 : 00 again this year .
I don &apos;t really have any control over that , Stanley .
Michael tends to procrastinate a bit whenever he has to do work .
Um , time cards .
He has to sign these every Friday .
Purchase orders have to be approved at the end of every month .
And expense reports .
All he has to do is initial these at the end of every quarter .
But once a year , it all falls on the same Friday .
And that &apos;s today .
I call it the perfect storm .
I don &apos;t want to work clinking mug with finger I just want to bang on this mug all day Did you ask me here for any specific reason ?
Ah , yes .
I did .
Here &apos;s the dizzle .
I have a very top secret mission for you .
I want you to update all the emergency contact information .
Why is that secret ?
knock at door ( Michael ) Hello .
Oh , God .
Busy work .
Get away .
Get away .
Ah , cretin .
Um , I put stickers so you know where to sign .
Yes , thanks .
I know where to sign .
It &apos;s just that last year , you-- Last year , they were out of order , weren &apos;t they , Pam ?
Well , the last pickup for overnight deliveries is at 7 : 00 , so you need to have them signed by then or much earlier .
Chillax , Pam .
Stop Pam-MSing .
That &apos;s pretty good .
Um , actually , I &apos;m sending Ryan on a top secret mission .
Tell her what it is .
Updating emergency contacts .
Well , is that really a priority ?
( Michael ) Is it a priority ?
Oh , I don &apos;t know .
Um , what if there &apos;s a tornado , Pam ?
People &apos;s legs are crushed under rubble .
Please , would you be so kind as to call my wife ?
No .
I can &apos;t .
Because we don &apos;t have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn &apos;t a priority .
Think .
Think with your head , Pam .
Okay , well , she walks out .
That &apos;s the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough , they resent you and when you are cool , they walk all over you .
Catch-22 .
Catch-22 .
Yes .
Why don &apos;t you give me your contact information to start with , okay ?
What &apos;s your cell ?
Uh , Larisa Halpert .
What &apos;s her address ?
cell phone rings Von Bergen Street .
Hello .
Michael in high voice Hey , Ryan .
snickers This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland .
You mean Neverland ?
This is Tito .
laughing What ?
Calling from-- Your major and minor lines cross at a ridge .
That sucks .
You &apos;re making this up as you go along , aren &apos;t you ?
I am just following the website .
Well ... at least I don &apos;t have cavities .
Yes , you have very nice teeth .
Thanks .
Who &apos;s your emergency contact ?
Stacey .
cell phone rings knock on window Pick up .
Hello ?
Michael in high voice This is Mike Tyson .
laughs TGIF .
Thank God it &apos;s Friday .
Mm .
Are you going to happy hour later ?
Ugh , I &apos;m still recovering from last night .
Ah .
But maybe .
Hey , Dwight .
As sempai , do you ever think there &apos;s gonna be a day where humans and robots can peacefully coexist ?
Impossible .
The way they &apos;re programmed ... You &apos;re mocking me .
No , I &apos;m not .
Well , let me offer you a little piece of advice .
I am not afraid to make an example out of you .
Well , that &apos;s not advice .
What advice sounds like is this .
Um , don &apos;t ever bring your purple belt to work because someone might steal it .
Okay , give that back to me .
Okay , say please .
No .
That is not a toy .
Please .
Please .
Good .
And it absolutely is a toy .
Arigato .
Arigato .
This is not a toy .
This is a message for the entire office so that everyone could see that I am capable of physically dominating them .
grunting And this is more of a yin-yang thing .
The Michael is all cursive , Scott all caps .
Left brain , right brain .
Or a duality of man .
knock on glass Could you practice on the forms ?
groans softly What about Oscar ?
Could you beat Oscar ?
No problem .
( Jim ) Oh , no , he looks pretty scrappy .
( Dwight ) Unless he has a shiv , in which case it wouldn &apos;t be a fair fight .
True .
Meredith ?
No women or children unless provoked .
Okay .
Roy .
Warehouse guy .
Doesn &apos;t count .
Okay .
Michael .
Could you beat up Michael ?
Yeah , I don &apos;t think that would happen .
&apos;Cause we &apos;re friends .
Because I would kick his ass .
Well , Dwight &apos;s purple belt , so ...
So ?
I &apos;ve beat up black belts .
Yeah .
How &apos;d you know they were black belts ?
They told me after .
See , I used to run with a very tough crowd , street fighter types .
Real , real bad people .
I &apos;m just lucky I got out .
I was a badass mofo .
Stanley knows what I &apos;m talking about .
Excuse me ?
Never lost a fight .
You know why ?
My motto .
Never say die .
You just said it .
You just said it .
No , that &apos;s not how I meant it .
He just-- No .
You said it .
Shut up , Dwight .
breathes deeply Do you think he signed them yet ?
Signed what ?
Forget it .
Is that chocolate vanilla swirl ?
Just chocolate .
Angela , for the last time , I did not eat your chocolate vanilla swirl .
Don &apos;t look at me .
I don &apos;t know why I write my name on things .
sighs Is your wife still your contact ?
Uh , ex-wife , yeah .
Uh , her last name is Becker now .
Okay .
You don &apos;t need to write &quot; ex &quot; .
( Michael ) And after that , nobody ever messed with the damn rascals ever again .
Sounds tough .
When you &apos;re a Jet , you &apos;re a Jet all the way , right ?
You &apos;re a Jet ?
Have you signed the expense reports yet ?
Yes , in theory I have .
I just need to cross some Ts and dot some Is .
All right .
I am going to be in my office , if anybody needs me .
Hoo !
Ha !
Oh , wow .
Michael .
Sleeper hold .
Bed time for vato .
Oh .
( Dwight ) Stop it .
( Michael ) Oh ho ho ho .
You are the weakest link .
Ow !
I &apos;m friends with everybody in this office .
We &apos;re all best friends .
I love everybody here .
But sometimes your best friends start coming in to work late and start having dentist appointments that aren &apos;t dentist appointments .
And that is when it &apos;s nice to let them know that you could beat them up .
Just hit me .
You &apos;ll see .
I can &apos;t .
&apos;Cause I just got a manicure , so ... Oh , queer !
Eye .
Queer Eye .
That &apos;s a good show .
Important show .
Go ahead .
Do it .
Just have Dwight punch you .
Oh , yeah .
Well , that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of 14-year-old girls who could kick his ass .
You know a ton of 14-year-old girls ?
Look .
Dwight is a wuss .
When we rented Armageddon , he cried at the end of it .
No , Michael , I told you .
That was because it was New Year &apos;s Eve and it started to snow at exactly midnight .
mock crying Bruce Willis .
They &apos;re going to leave him on the asteroid .
Okay , I &apos;ll punch you .
Oh , okay .
Here we go .
All right .
Come on .
Gah !
coughs , gags inhaling deeply Oh !
Did I want to harm Michael , the one man I &apos;ve been hired to protect ?
No , I did not .
Are you okay ?
hoarse Yes .
Are you sure you &apos;re all right ?
Yeah .
Yeah .
Thank you .
I come from a long line of fighters .
My maternal grandfather was the toughest guy I ever knew .
World War II veteran .
Killed 20 men then spent the rest of the war in an allied prison camp .
My father battled blood pressure and obesity all his life .
Different kind of fight .
Still noble .
If I come for you-- &apos; cause your cartilage can go right through .
Okay , take this pen and stab me with it .
Okay , he has to be stopped .
Please , please , please , please , just ask Michael .
indistinct chatter I don &apos;t know .
Ha .
Okay .
I &apos;ll buy you a bag of chips .
French onion ?
Obviously .
Why are you spinning around ?
Okay .
Yes .
Take this pen , okay ?
Stab me with it .
( Michael ) Go away .
I just have a quick question .
I haven &apos;t signed them , okay ?
No , it &apos;s not that .
Um , I was just wondering , since I &apos;m probably going to have to stay late , could you ask Dwight to stay late too so he can walk me to my car ?
Come in .
Uh , Pam , I hate to break this to you , but Dwight can &apos;t stop you from being mugged .
He &apos;s just not tough enough .
He &apos;s a purple belt .
That &apos;s really high .
Oh , I could beat up Dwight .
That &apos;s ridiculous .
I can murder him .
It &apos;s just that out there , you ... Oh , is that what they &apos;re saying ?
Yeah , kind of .
Okay .
All right .
Where &apos;s Dwight ?
Uh , kitchen .
Okay .
( Dwight ) Try it again .
Here we go .
Hi-yah !
Good .
Wow , it was actually pretty close , right ?
Excellent .
Now watch .
Let me take you from behind .
What ?
( Michael ) Watch out , Kelly .
He might sucker punch you .
I didn &apos;t sucker punch you , Michael .
No , really ?
In case you didn &apos;t remember , I was defending my honor .
Like a samurai .
Really ?
Yeah .
Well , the offer , Dwight , was for one punch , which I absorbed .
I had no idea that there &apos;d be a second punch .
So catch-22 .
( Dwight ) Okay , fine .
Tit for tit .
Give it your best shot .
Two punches .
Go .
Look .
If we were in a bar right now , there would be two punches .
Me punching you and you hitting the floor .
No , I &apos;d block your first punch rendering you ineffective .
Oh , really ?
Yeah .
You know what , you &apos;re just lucky that we &apos;re at work right now .
Ooh , what about Dwight &apos;s dojo ?
No , they just have classes .
It &apos;s free during the day .
It &apos;s fine .
I &apos;ve got the key .
Hey , Michael .
Hey , Toby .
Any word on those time cards ?
Hey , you know what ?
I have an idea .
Why don &apos;t you leave right now ?
Why don &apos;t you walk away from the room , okay ?
Fine .
We &apos;ll go at lunch .
Pam , make an announcement .
Figure out carpools .
He &apos;s leaving the office ?
I know ... You gotta be kidding me .
( Jim ) Um , well , we &apos;re all getting excited to see this fight .
The Albany Branch is working right through lunch to prevent downsizing .
But Michael , he decided to extend our lunch by an hour so that we could all go down to the dojo and watch him fight Dwight .
Fight .

I &apos;m coming .

Sorry .
elevator dings I recognize that .
That is Japanese for California roll .
Uh , no , it &apos;s not .
I think it is .
A guy told me about that .
Actually , it &apos;s a symbol for eternal discipline .
Oh .
Your shoes .
Yes ?
You &apos;re gonna have to take &apos; em off .
It &apos;s a sign of respect .
Oh .
Well , in my office if you took off your shoes , it would be a sign of disrespect .
Stinky feet feel .
Kind of a yin-yang .
Hoo-ch-ch-ch-cha !
Ch-ch-ch-ch-cha !
Oh , stretching .
I like to stay tight .
Compact .
Gaaah !

No , just white .
All right .
Wow .
That is really interesting .

Oh , put me down .
laughing Put me down .
Oh my God .
Hey , put me down .
Hey .
You ready ?
Okay , gentlemen , listen up .
After a clean strike to the chest , stomach , or kidneys , I will separate you and award a point .
First person to three wins , all right ?
Yes , sensei .
Lot of rules .
Lot of rules .
On the street , we didn &apos;t have any rules .
Maybe one .
No kicks to the groin .
Home for dinner .
Hi , sensei !
Hi , Dwight !
That &apos;s Alyssa , my sempai .
She just qualified for regionals .
Osu !
Alyssa ?
I guess she &apos;s technically the sempai .
But nobody really respects her .
The only reason she got into regionals was because her competition was a bunch of 13-year-old girls .
scoffs Put me in that division .
Let &apos;s see how she does .
Hajime !
Ha-yah !
Whoa , hey !

Stan the Man .
Hi , Michael .
Did you hear about the fight ?
Well , wasn &apos;t much of a fight , actually .
( Stanley ) No , are those purchase-- I opened a big ol &apos; can of whup-ass on him .
Huh ?
I went medieval on his hiney .
Okay , are those purchase orders signed ?
( Michael ) Hey , Stanley , I don &apos;t tell you how to do your job , do I ?
Look , I just wanna have a job , Michael .
If we don &apos;t get these purchase orders-- Grow a pair , Stanley .
Right ?
You &apos;re not gonna downsize because I miss a lot of deadlines .
It &apos;s not how business works , okay ?
Okay .
For the record , let me just say Michael Scott has no honor .
If he lived in Japan , he would be an outcast .
My emergency contact is Tod Pecker .
Tod F. Pecker .
You know what the F standings for ?
Fudge ?
knock on door Uh , come in .
Oh , hey , Karate Kid .
The Hilary Swank version .
Hi .
How are you ?
I need to change my emergency contact information from Michael Scott .
Okay , to what ?
Just put ... the hospital .
Contact number , just put 911. pen scratching out information He is such a sore loser .
You heard obviously that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon .
You know what , um , do yourself a favor .
Just leave me as his contact and I will call the hospital .
Cut out the middleman .
pen scratching out information Good night , Toby .
( Toby ) Bye , Kelly .

Later , Kev .
Have a good weekend .
Yeah , you too .
knocks at door Yeah .
I have the emergency contacts .
Just lay &apos; em on the chair .
I &apos;ll take it from here .
So what you up to this weekend ?
Uh , hanging out with some friends probably .
Well , if you do anything crazy , give me a shout .
Yeah .
All right .
I will , um , see you Monday .
All right .
Bye .
breathes deeply All right , here you go , princess .
Just finished with part one .
This is what you had Ryan do .
Yes , under my tutelage .
But what about the other stuff ?
That has to be in today .
If you didn &apos;t badger me with so many questions , Pam , I could be done with it by now .
Dwight .
Michael , did you finish yet ?
This close .
Dwight , may I speak with you for a minute ?
Uh , I &apos;m busy .
Well , busier .
But I &apos;m making the time .
Michael , can &apos;t your conversation wait till Monday ?
We want to go home .
Well , you don &apos;t even have anybody to go home to , Toby .
The shipping place closes in a half hour .
I know .
But I &apos;ve been carrying the load on my back all day .
And if everyone would just chip in a little bit , might help me out .
What do you say ?
Let &apos;s gang bang this thing and go home .
Good ?
Dwight .
This is illegal .
I don &apos;t care .
I have been testing you the entire day .
Did you know that ?
Of course .
And I &apos;m happy to say that you passed .
So effective immediately , I am promoting you from assistant to the regional manager to assistant regional manager .
gasps Michael ...
I don &apos;t know-- I know .
I know .
I know .
I know .
I wouldn &apos;t be offering it if I didn &apos;t think you could handle it .
I can handle it .
I can .
I know .
Okay .
sighs Wow .
So I guess this &apos;ll just be my office .
No .
No .
Title change only .
I &apos;ll have Pam send out a memo .
No .
No .
Three month probationary period .
Let &apos;s just not tell anybody about this right now .
Just a formality ?
Absolutely .
But not really .
Michael ...
I have so much to learn from you .
Yes , you do .
Thank you ... sensei .
And ditto .
I told Dwight that there is honor in losing , which as we all know is completely ridiculous .
But there is however honor in making a loser feel better , which is what I just did for Dwight .
Would I rather be feared or loved ?
Um , easy .
Both .
I want people to be afraid of how much they love me .
And I think I proved that today at the dojo .
Typewriter torture .
Sensei , help .
Typewriter torture .
No .
Typewriter .
As a boss , I &apos;m always telling my employees , &quot; No pain , no gain . &quot;
And if that &apos;s true , Dwight gained an awful lot today .
A lot .
He gained a lesson .
Don &apos;t mess with me .
He gained knowledge .
See what happens when you mess with me ?
And he gained pain .
Which is what happens when you mess with me .
- Hello .
Pammy want a cracker ?
bawks like chicken - No , thanks .
You got a package .
- Ooh , Pam with the dirty talk .
laughs - And he &apos;s lining it up .
Seems pretty straightforward from here .
whispering If Michael Scott sinks it , he &apos;ll win a Buick signed by Tiger Woods .
- Oh !
- Oh , he totally misses .
- whispering No , he meant to put it right next to the hole .
That &apos;s much harder to do .
- gasps Ah , interception !
He shoots , he scores .
Yeah !
Michael , try it like this .
This &apos;ll be much harder .
- No , no , no , no , no , no .
I don &apos;t want to chip my mug .

It &apos;s really back there .
Yeah .
- Do you feel it ?
- I can barely-- ceramic shatters - Gah , damn it , Dwight .
That &apos;s great .
- Should I clean out my desk ?
- That won &apos;t be necessary .
upbeat piano music - Most of that is good .
- Not today , Kevin .
I cannot be around carbs today .
You know what one loaf of bread would do to my abs ?
- I &apos;m almost there , so we should have plenty of time to go over the presentation .
- Mm-hmm .
- And , uh , clears throat excuse me .
I &apos;ve also confirmed the meeting this afternoon at 4 : 00 pm .

Would you like your confirmation number ?
Please grab a pen because I will only be repeating this once .
- I &apos;ll see you in ten minutes .

Do you know who you &apos;re talking to ?
I &apos;m Michael Scott .
&quot; Really ?
Well , take any lead you want . &quot;

Because I have a client list right here in my computer .
exhales So , suck on that .
- Hey .
- Hi .

I think I was just staring at my desk .
- Really ?
Do you want to get back to that ?
I could go .
I should go .
- Yeah , do you mind leaving ?
- Not at all .
- It &apos;s very important .
- Mm-hmm .
I &apos;m sorry to interrupt .
- Hey , have they left for the big meeting yet ?
I got Michael &apos;s lucky tie .
- No , they &apos;re in the conference room .
- Okay .
- Wait .
Are those Michael &apos;s Levi &apos;s ?
- Yeah .
Who dry-cleans jeans ?
- Michael and his jeans .
He gets in them and I &apos;m not exactly sure what happens , but I can tell you , he loves the way he looks in those jeans .
I know that &apos;s why he started casual Fridays .
I &apos;ll take those .
Thanks .
- This is a projection of the county &apos;s needs .
- Wow , graphs and charts .
Somebody &apos;s really been doing their homework .
Looks like &quot; USA Today . &quot;
- 13 schools , 2 hospitals .
- So , this possible client they &apos;re talking about .
Actually , a big deal .
It &apos;s Lackawanna County .
Our whole county .
And if we get this , they might not have to downsize our branch .
And I could work here for years .
And years and ... years .
- So , when we get to the Radisson , I &apos;d like to-- - Oh , I changed it to Chili &apos;s .
- Excuse me ?
- Radisson just gives out this vibe .
It &apos;s like , &quot; Oh , I &apos;m doing business at the Radisson . &quot;
It &apos;s kinda snooty , so ... - You had no right to do that , Michael .
- Here &apos;s the thing , Chili &apos;s is the new golf course .
It &apos;s where business happens .
&quot; Small Businessman Magazine . &quot;
- It said that .
- It will .
I sent it in .
Letter to the editor .
- All right .
But you will let me run this meeting .
- Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
Power trip .
- What ?
- What is it like to close a really big sale ?
Think of the best orgasm you ever had in your life .
And divide it in half .
It &apos;s that good .
- She had done a background check on me .
She had it printed out .
- No .
- Yeah , and she was asking me about stuff line by line while we were having dinner .
- That is unbelievable .
- What &apos;s going on ?
- We are doing worst first dates .
- Oh , my God , I win .
Okay , it was a minor league hockey game .
He brought his brother .
And when I went to the bathroom , the game ended , and they forgot about me .
- Okay , that &apos;s a joke .
- No , they had to come back for me .
- Wait , when was this ?
- Um ... it was not that long ago .
- Wait , not Roy .
Say it &apos;s not your fiancé .
laughing - I always knew Pam has refused to go to sports games with Roy .
But I never knew why .
Interesting .
- Oh , that is messed up .
- laughs - Ha , ha .
Who &apos;s next ?
- Pam , that &apos;s awful .
- What was my worst first date ?
Um ... it was a couple years ago .
It was a lunch date .
Actually , it was right down here at Cugino &apos;s .
And we had just met and we really hit it off .
It was ... kinda nice .
Um ... and , uh , then , as it turned out , it wasn &apos;t even a date because ... she was actually in love with someone else .
So ... best first date &apos;s also my worst first date , oddly enough .
chuckles - Okay , let &apos;s do this thing .
Wish us luck .
- Good luck , Michael .
Good luck , Jan. - Thank you .
- quietly Kiss ass .
Okay ... probably going to go late tonight .
Burning the midnight tequila .
So , I think you all could just take off now .
- Michael , this shouldn &apos;t take more than an hour .
- Well ... - Do you always shut down the entire office when you leave for an hour ?
- No , no , that would not be efficient .
Actually , they just don &apos;t get very much work done when I &apos;m not here .
That &apos;s not true .
I know how to delegate .
And they do more work when I &apos;m not here .
Not more .
The same amount of work is done whether I am here or not .
Hey , everybody , listen up !
This is what we &apos;re gonna do .
You sit tight until I return .
Sound good ?
Doesn &apos;t matter .
It &apos;s an order .
Follow it blindly .
Mm-ha-ha !
Okay ?
All right , ciao .
Adios !
- So , which way is Chili &apos;s ?
- Ah , I &apos;ll drive .
- No , that &apos;s all right .
I wanna leave straight from there .
- It is just a couple blocks away , so-- boy , you really don &apos;t know Scranton , do you ?
- I know Scranton .
- At all .
Have you ever been to Scranton , Jen ?
- If it &apos;s a couple blocks away , we can go together .
- Dur-de-dur-de-dur .
Okay .
Jan Levinson-Gould .
Jan is cold .
If she was sitting across from you on a train , and she wasn &apos;t moving , you might think she was dead .
And I want to be the guy sitting across from her who reaches out and just punches her in the chest and gets her heart going again .
sighs loudly Remember in high school , driving around in a convertible was like the coolest thing you could do .
Remember ?
- I &apos;m feeling so good I can &apos;t even take it - What high school did you go to ?
Catholic girls &apos; school ?
- Uh ... - You keep reading that , you &apos;re gonna get carsick .
Oh , you know what ?
Reminds me .
We should come up with a signal of some sort .
- Why would we need a signal ?
- Well , in case one of us gets into trouble , the other one can signal-- - What kind of trouble are you planning on getting in , Michael ?
- Well , it could be either of us .
- You &apos;re gonna let me do the talking , we agreed on that .
- Yes .
radio playing loudly - Feeling so good I can &apos;t even take it - It &apos;s too loud , Michael .
- What ?
- It &apos;s too loud !
- I can &apos;t hear you over the music .
Oh , right , we &apos;re almost there .
- And my body &apos;s burning up so hot Nobody has to be something they &apos;re not - Do you think they &apos;ll get the account ?
How come you never answer me ?
- I &apos;m sorry , Phyllis .
No , I don &apos;t think they &apos;ll get the account .
- Hello ?
Christian ?
- Yes .
- Thought that was you .
Hi .
- Hi .
- Michael Scott .
This is Jan Levinson-Gould .
- Just Jan Levinson .
- No Gould ?
- No .
Thank you very much for meeting with us .
Have you been waiting long ?
- No , not long .
- Good , good .
- Uh , Jan , what happened ?
- Michael .
- Is Gould dead ?
What , uh ... - Michael .
We got divorced , okay ?
I &apos;m so sorry , excuse me .
- Wow , you &apos;re kidding me .
Do you wanna talk about it ?
- Michael .
Could we have a table for three please ?
- When did this happen ?
- We &apos;re in a meeting .
- Okay .
- This way , please .
- All right , after you .
- Thank you .
- I thought we could start by going over the needs of the county .
- Right .
Well , Lackawanna County has not been immune to the slow economic growth over the past five years .
So for us , the name of the game is budget reduction .
- Awesome Blossom ?
- What ?
- I think we should share an Awesome Blossom .
What do you say ?
They are awesome .
You want to , Christian ?
Awesome ?
- Sure , sure .
- Okay , it &apos;s done .
Actually , Megan ?
May we have an Awesome Blossom , please ?
Extra awesome ?
Now it is done .
- So , if you have-- - Hey , I heard a very , very funny joke the other day .
You wanna hear it ?
- Christian , you don &apos;t-- you don &apos;t have to listen to this .
- It &apos;s okay .
I like jokes .
- Okay .
- Just the one .
- Just one joke ?
Okay .
Well , if it &apos;s just gonna be one ...
I will think of a different joke .
Um ... - Dunder Miflin , this is Pam .
- Pam , it &apos;s Michael .
I need you to go into my office and check some data for me .
- Okay .
Um , you want me to read &apos; em ?
- Yes .
- Okay .
Um , a fisherman is walking down 5th Avenue leading an animal behind him .
- Nope !
Nope , told it .
Not as good as you think .
Pick another one .
- Okay .
There &apos;s a transcript between a Naval ship-- - Oh , hey !
Bingo .
And a lighthouse .
Yes , that is hysterical .
Could you start that one from the beginning ?
- Sure .
There &apos;s a transcript between a naval ship and a lighthouse .
- Is this real ?
- It is a screenplay .
Starring himself .
- Agent Michael Scarn .
- Of the FBI .
- How long is this ?
Oh , Pam , good work .
Oh , wait , stop .
Drawings .
- What is that ?
- Oh , those are drawings , in case the writing didn &apos;t really put a picture in your head .
And there he is , in the flesh , Agent Michael Scarn .
Now we know what he looks like .
- First guy says , &quot; Well , I &apos;m an astronaut , so I drive a Saturn . &quot;
And the second guy says , &quot; Well , I am a pimp , so I drive a cheap Escort . &quot;
And the third guy says , &quot; I got you both beat .
&quot; I &apos;m a proctologist so I drive a brown Probe . &quot;
- laughing Oh , no !
Oh , my God , that &apos;s funny !
I almost had Awesome Blossom coming out of my nose !
laughing - Excuse me , could I have a vodka tonic , please ?
- Oh , drinks .
both chanting Drinks , drinks , drinks , drinks .
- Vodka tonic .
both : Drinks , drinks , drinks .
- No , you know what ?
Cancel that .
Uh , I hear ... makes whooshing noise an El Niño coming in .
El Niños for everyone .
- Oh , no , no , no .
- Yes , mm-hmm .
Mm-hmm .
- I love El Niño margaritas .
both laugh Yes !
Oh .
- Oh .
- Awesome !
- Isn &apos;t it ?
- Mm !
- That dipping sauce .
- Do we all have our copy of &quot; Threat Level Midnight &quot; by Michael Scott ?
all murmuring assent All right , let &apos;s get this started .
I &apos;m gonna be reading the action descriptions .
And Phyllis , I would like you to play Catherine Zeta-Jones .
- That &apos;s the character &apos;s name ?
- You guys should not be doing this .
- Why not , Dwight ?
This is a movie .
I mean , this is for all of America to enjoy .
- You took something that doesn &apos;t belong to you .
- Dwight .
- Brought it in here , made copies of it-- - Do you want to play the lead role of Agent Michael Scarn ?
- Argh !
munching noises That &apos;s delicious !
- laughing - I love it .
- Can we--can we , uh ... could we talk about your account , please ?
- Okay , downer .
chuckles - Are you upset , Jan ?
- No !
I &apos;m--no , I &apos;m not .
I &apos;m not upset .
- I mean , it &apos;s okay .
I know what it &apos;s like .
You know , my parents were divorced .
- Oh , really ?
- It was tough at first but then I sort of liked it , you know ?
I had two rooms .
My dad &apos;s place was like a fort and my mom &apos;s place was home base .
- Did you have bunk beds ?
- No .
No , I didn &apos;t .
- Ah .
sighs - That &apos;s too bad .
- I wish I &apos;d had bunk beds .
- I &apos;d get &apos; em now .
- Yes , that &apos;s too bad .
Okay , we would probably be upset with ourselves if we went this whole night without talking business .
So , Dunder Miflin can provide a level of personal service to the county that suppliers like Staples can &apos;t match .
- Well , we are out to save money .
- What &apos;s the bottom line ?
- Blah !
Blah , blah , blah .
speaking nonsense That &apos;s why I wanted a signal between us .
So , I wouldn &apos;t have to just shout nonsense words .
That &apos;s her fault .
Did somebody say baby back ribs ?
Hmm ?
Hmm ?
- I don &apos;t think Christian has time for that , Michael .
- I have time .
- I want my baby back , baby back , baby back both : I want my baby back , baby back , baby back I want my baby back baby back baby back - Chili &apos;s baby back ribs - Location , a bank .
A man , very good looking , runs into a bank and kills a bank robber .
- I am Michael Scarn with the FBI .
Freeze .
- Who &apos;s he saying &quot; freeze &quot; to if the bank robber &apos;s dead ?
- I don &apos;t know .
Inside the FBI , Agent Michael Scarn sits with his feet up on his desk .
Catherine Zeta-Jones enters .
- Um , sir , you have some messages .
- Not now !
- They &apos;re important .
- Okay , what are they ?
- The first message is : I love you .
That &apos;s from me .
- Not in a thousand years , Catherine .
We work together .
And get off my desk .
Yes , I have acted before .
I was in a production of &quot; Oklahoma ! &quot;
in the seventh grade .
I played the part of Mutey the Mailman .
They had too many kids , so they made up roles like that .
I was good .
Let &apos;s maintain this-- what are you--where you going ?
- Home .
It &apos;s after 5 : 00 .
- Yeah , but Michael said for us to stay until he got back .
- Okay .
- What is-- when he comes back , he &apos;s gonna see you &apos;re not here .
- Okay .
- Okay ... don &apos;t let it affect your performance .
Here we go .
Phyllis .
- The President called .
- Business or social ?
- Both .
He has an assignment for you .
Very dangerous , maybe deadly and he wants you to be the best man at his wedding .
- Put him through .
But I &apos;m only gonna talk business .
- Hey , Michael .
How &apos;s it hanging ?
- It &apos;s hanging pretty good , Mr. President .
I understand you have a dangerous assignment and I &apos;m your man .
- I do .
I have a dangerous assignment .
Are you my man ?
- You heard me the first time , you joker .
- That would be pretty cool if Michael starred in a movie with Catherine Zeta-Jones .
She is so hot .
all singing to tune of &quot; Happy Birthday &quot; Happy retirement to you Happy retirement to you - Stop !
Everyone , I &apos;m not retiring .
- Everyone stops singing &apos; cause he &apos;s not retiring .
- Well , if it isn &apos;t my old partner , Samuel L. Chang .
- Agent Michael Scarn , you lost some weight .
- Thank you for noticing .
Now , keep me company for one more mission .
- whispering Hey , I have to work late .
- As soon as I blow out these candles , I &apos;m retired .
- You &apos;re joking , right ?
- Michael Scarn takes out a nine millimeter gun and shoots the cake to bits .
- making gun noises - Ha , ha , ha .
Agent Michael Scarn , you so funny .
Word .
- Michael &apos;s movie ?
Two thumbs down .
loud sucking noises - I bet 100 .
- Sir , the minimum bet is 1,000 .
- If you had let me finish my sentence , you would have heard me say , &quot; I bet 100,000 . &quot;
Sam , get me my money bag .
- Ha , ha , ha , ha .
Agent Michael Scarn , you so funny .
You da bomb .
- Mm , yeah .
It kinda seems like all the movies that I like .
- A man sitting several seats down who has a gold face turns to Michael Scarn .
Uh , ooh .
Oscar , you wanna play Goldenface ?
- clears throat Mr. Scarn , perhaps you would be comfortable in my private jet .
- Yes , perhaps I would , Goldenface .
Sam , get my luggage .
- I forget it , brotha .
- Samuel , you are such an idiot !
You are the worst assistant ever .
And you &apos;re disgusting , Dwigt .
Wait , who &apos;s &quot; Dwigt &quot; ?
- Here &apos;s what we think happened .
Michael &apos;s sidekick , who all through the movie is this complete idiot who &apos;s causing the downfall of the United States , was originally named Dwight .
But then Michael changed it to Samuel L. Chang using a search and replace .
But that doesn &apos;t work on misspelled words .
Leaving behind one Dwigt .
And Dwight figured it out .
Oops .
- D-W-I-G-H-T .
Okay , you know what ?
I am done with this .
That &apos;s it , the end .
- Well , some of us wanna keep reading-- - Uh , you don &apos;t speak for everyone , Jim .
Okay , announcement .
My uncle bought me some fireworks .
And anyone who wants to see a real show , come with me outside now .
- That &apos;s actually a good idea .
We &apos;ll all take a brief intermission .
Hey , are you hungry ?
- Yeah .
- Yeah ?
- And so after watching my mom go through so much pain , I decided to keep that promise that I made to her .
And take care of her .
- Hoo .
Well , this brings us to Jan.
Truth or dare .
Tell us about your divorce .
- Oh , no , Michael .
Michael , Michael .
- Do , do .
- Michael , Michael , please .
No , really .
- Oh , hey .
So , you &apos;re not gonna play .
She &apos;s not playing .
- That &apos;s not fair .
- She &apos;s not playing the game .
- We &apos;d been fighting for a while .
He didn &apos;t want kids .
I knew that going into it .
But he also knew that I did .
So , I guess I thought that he would change his mind .
He thought that I would change mine .
- You didn &apos;t .
- I was stupid .
- No , no , you were not stupid .
Gould was stupid , right ?
- That &apos;s right .
- You know ?
- You were really brave .
I mean , you put your arms out there .
You slit your wrist .
- That &apos;s true .
- You said , &quot; World , this is my blood .
&quot; It &apos;s red , just like yours .
So , love me . &quot;
- I had plans to meet a friend tonight .
Which I had to cancel .
But this is cool , too .
I &apos;m not a complainer .
Wow .
- For the bugs .
- Nice .
That &apos;s excellent because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich .
- Yes !
Nice .
Okay , what &apos;s in here ?
- Uh , sliced tomato .
Uh , we happened to have one around , actually .
I just had to wash off the name &quot; Angela &quot; ?
- I guess that &apos;s a tomato company .
- I guess you &apos;re right .
- I can &apos;t remember the last time someone made me dinner .
- Whoa !
Yeah , whoo !
Whoo !
whooping and hollering Whoo-hoo !
- Right down the street ?
- Mm-hmm .
Kenneth Road , born and raised .
Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County .
And I do not intend on moving .
I know this place .
I know how many hospitals we have .
I know how many schools we have .
It &apos;s home , you know ?
I know the challenges that this county &apos;s up against .
Here &apos;s the thing about those discount suppliers , they don &apos;t care .
They come in , they undercut everything .
And they run us out of business .
And then , once we &apos;re all gone , they jack up the prices .
- I know .
- It &apos;s bad .
- It &apos;s terrible .
- It is--you know what ?
It really is .
- Uh-- - I don &apos;t know .
I guess I could give you guys our business , but you have to meet me halfway , okay ?
Because they &apos;re expecting me to make cuts .
- Well , corporate &apos;s gonna go ballistic , but you think we could , Jan ?
- Bullets are flying everywhere .
Ooh , wait , last page .
Big finish , here we go .
Agent Scarn kicks open the plane door with a karate chop .
- A kick and a chop are two totally different things .
- Well , it &apos;s just a movie , Dwigt .
- It doesn &apos;t make any sense .
- Yeah , now it doesn &apos;t make any sense .
- Don &apos;t jump , Agent Scarn .
There are no parachutes .
- Just then , Agent Chang gets a bullet in the head .
- Oh , so close to retirement .
- Another bullet heads towards Agent Michael Scarn but he jumps out of the plane without a parachute .
- Is that it ?
- Yup , I guess so .
- Does he die ?
- I sincerely doubt it .
- I have to say , I think this is a terrible movie .
- So , I guess I &apos;ll see you in ... ten hours .
- What are you gonna do with your time off ?
- Travel .
- Yeah .
- I &apos;ve been looking forward to it .
It &apos;s gonna be ... really nice .
I &apos;m gonna find myself .
- You have new music ?
- Yeah .
Definitely .
soft rock music playing - See ya .
- Bye .
Thanks .
Yes !
- We did it .
- We got it !
- Nailed it .
- I mean , we got it !
- Nailed it !
Come here .
- Oh !
- grunts playfully - laughs - I am really ... thrilled .
Let &apos;s go .
- What ?
Let &apos;s go .
Go and--okay .
Where are we going ?
Doesn &apos;t matter .
Goin &apos; to the go-go .
Okay .
- Michael ?
Michael ?
Michael ?
His car &apos;s not in the parking lot .
I should check the accident reports .
Who &apos;s this ?
Jan ?
car beeps - My craft group thinks I &apos;m negative .
I &apos;m gonna try to be a better person .
Someone took my tomato .
Morning , Pam .
- Michael loves his entrance lines .
He always has one .
It &apos;s usually , like , some version of my name , like a pun , but not really .
And today , nothing .
It was really odd .
- Made the sale last night .
- All right .
clapping - How &apos;d everything go here ?
- Good .
- Good .
No , nothing happened .
I swear !
Nothing happened .
What--I &apos;m totally being serious .
A gentleman does not kiss and tell .
And neither do I. laughs I &apos;m-- No , seriously , guys , I &apos;m not-- I don &apos;t wanna go into it at all .
It &apos;s off limits .
Fine , I took her back to her hotel , and we made out for a little while .
It was great .
I mean , she told me about her divorce .
We talked for about five hours .
She fell asleep on my arm .
Hello , Dwight .
- Did you do her ?
- Who ?
- Jan Levinson-Gould .
- Uh , no , no .
No Gould .
- Did you do her ?
- This is none of your affair .
Because she is your boss .
- And she is your boss .
- And she is a woman .
She is a strong , soft , thoughtful , sexy woman .
And you know what ?
I don &apos;t think I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor .
Jan , I defend your honor .
Is that all ?
- Jan didn &apos;t come back for her car last night .
- What ?
- Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta ?
- Oh , I don &apos;t know ... phone rings Oh , my God .
This is Jan &apos;s cell .
- No way .
- Dunder Miflin , this is Pam .
- I know we have to register as a consensual sexual relationship with HR .
My question , do I do it as the man , does she do it as my superior ?
I don &apos;t know .
That leads to other issues that we may have in our relationship .
It &apos;s , uh ... phone ringing Excuse me .
Hello ?
Hi .
Just talking about you .
The camera , no .
Uh-huh .
How &apos;s traffic ?
I miss you .
What ?
Okay .
Well ... if it was a mistake , it was a wonderful mistake .
No .
Just ... No , I did not intentionally get you drunk .
Mm-hmm .
No , no .
This is just a fight .
This is just a first fight of many fights we &apos;re gonna have .
Right .
No .
You--I don &apos;t understand .
You wanna see other people .
Only other people .
Wha--okay .
I think you &apos;re still a little bit drunk .
Excuse me .
Excuse me ?
I think you &apos;re st--yes .
Why don &apos;t you just come back here ?
We can go to the hotel .
Have a few drinks .
No , I didn &apos;t slip you something !
- Some might even say we had our first date last night .
- Oh , really ?
- Really .
- Why might some say that ?
- &apos; Cause there was dinner .
By candlelight .
- Mm-hmm .
- Dinner and a show if you include Michael &apos;s movie .
And there was dancing and fireworks .
Pretty good date .
- We didn &apos;t dance .
- You &apos;re right , we didn &apos;t dance .
It was more like ... swaying .
But still romantic .
Swaying isn &apos;t dancing .
- At least I didn &apos;t leave you at a high school hockey game .
- I have some faxes to get out .
- Oh , come on , Pam , I-- Okay , we didn &apos;t dance .
And I was totally joking , anyway .
I mean , it &apos;s not really a date if the girl goes home to her fiancé .
Right ?
- Did I ?
Yeah .
I closed a huge account once .
Xerox .
Hundreds of millions of dollars .
There was some confusion though .
They thought they were selling to me and I thought I was selling to them .
But , wow , still .
That was a night .

( Oscar ) Today is performance review day company-wide , and I &apos;m a little concerned about my review .
I exceeded my sick days and my personal days because I just couldn &apos;t take it .
( Oscar ) And I don &apos;t have a good answer for him when he asks me .
inhales deeply So .
Michael , I don &apos;t know what to say .
Um , you &apos;re in accounting .

( Pam ) It &apos;s performance review day company-wide .
Last year , my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were , and it ended with him telling me he could bench-press pounds .
So I don &apos;t really know what to expect .
Pam , you &apos;re trustworthy .
Thank you .
And a woman .
Oh , no .
And I want you to listen to a voice mail from my boss .
Jan on answering machine Michael , it &apos;s Jan.
I guess I missed you .
I &apos;ll , uh , be there this afternoon for performance reviews .
I hope it &apos;s understood that that will be our only topic of discussion .
See you soon .
First impressions ?
Uh , just off the top , I think she &apos;ll be here this afternoon .

The lovely Jan Levinson-Gould .
W-well , no Gould .
The Gould has been chop noise divorce .
Um , the awkward part is that this is the first time we &apos;ll be seeing each other since ... well .
Uh , it was really nothing .
We just sort of got caught up in the moment .
The vulnerable divorcée gives herself to the understanding with rugged good looks office manager .
Just , uh , she didn &apos;t want it to continue for some reason .
We both didn &apos;t-- I didn &apos;t want-- we both didn &apos;t want it to continue .
It was not professional .
Um , when people say something &apos;s mutual , it never is .
But this was mutual .
( Pam ) I guess I missed you .
I guess I missed you .
So she misses me .
She missed you .
But then , she goes on to say , &quot; That will be our only topic of discussion . &quot;
That doesn &apos;t mean anything .
Those are just words .
I have one idea of what it means .
Okay .
Yeah .
What ?
What ?
Well , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re going to be very happy with this .
Oh , great .
All right , well , now I &apos;m in a terrible mood .
pen clicks inhales deeply Let &apos;s do your performance review .
Because she &apos;s conflicted .
She has to be professional , but she &apos;s fighting feelings for you .
Ah .
Why-- that &apos;s great news .
That--that-- then why would-- why would I not like that ?
Um , just cause that you work together , and it might be awkward .
Wow , wow .
All right , let &apos;s listen to that again .
( Pam ) Michael , it &apos;s Jan.
I guess I missed you .
Oh , hey .
Listen , Jim .
Here &apos;s a little tip for your performance review .
Okay .
Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manilla file folders .
We don &apos;t have double-tabbed manilla files folders .
Oh , yes we do .
No , we don &apos;t .
Yeah , it &apos;s a new product .
So you should just suggest that to him , and then he &apos;ll be sure to give you a raise .
Uh-huh .
We &apos;ll , I &apos;m not asking for a raise .
I &apos;m gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease .
Uh , that is so stupid .
What if he gives it to you ?
I win .
Ugh .
You know what , I am going to zone you out for the rest of today , okay ?
I need to stay focused .
And I don &apos;t have to see you tomorrow or Sunday .
And please don &apos;t call me , and we &apos;ll see how things go on Monday .
sighs Stupid .
Wait , wait .
One thing .
Um , by tomorrow , you mean Saturday , right ?
Uh , duh .
Duh .
Today is Thursday .
But Dwight thinks that it &apos;s Friday .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;ll be working on this afternoon .
Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words .
Really .
Oh , yes .
Let &apos;s listen to it again .
And this time , really listen to the pauses .
God , Stanley , that &apos;s freakin &apos; brilliant .
How do you know that ?
Did you learn that on the streets ?
Sorry .
Oh , it &apos;s okay .
I did learn it on the streets .
On the ghetto , in fact .
No kidding .
It &apos;s all about my bonus .
Michael and Jan definitely made out .
Oh .
Maybe more .
Ugh .
Oh , also , it is Thursday , but Dwight thinks it &apos;s Friday , so keep that going .
Oh , yay .
Good work , Stanley .
Great performance review .
Stanley in the house , everybody .
Whoo !
Angela , your turn .
( Angela ) I actually look forward to performance reviews .
I did the youth beauty pageant circuit , and I enjoyed that quite a bit .
I really enjoy being judged .
I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny .
Michael .
Yeah .
Jan &apos;s on the phone for you .
Oh .
Angela , you were totally satisfactory this year .
door slams Interesting .
Jan is calling me .
Maybe it wasn &apos;t so mutual after all .
Yeah .
Jan on speakerphone Michael .
Jan , to what do I owe this pleasure ?
I am returning your many calls .
Well , hello to you , too .
Um , yeah , I was just , um , I just wanted to get some closure on what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili &apos;s .
No .
No , we--we won &apos;t be discussing that , Michael .
The only things I want to talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch .
Well , surely this , uh , review is a formality because of what happened , uh , at our meeting in the parking lot of the Chili &apos;s .
Review is anything but a formality , Michael .
And , uh , I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior .
Been thinking about you .
Okay , that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior .
Mm , I don &apos;t see how that &apos;s unprofessional .
Michael .
Yeah ?
Are the cameras in there with you in your office ?
No , they are not .
Yes , they are .
sighs phone hangs up dial tone droning That &apos;s my girlfriend .
I heard they made out and had sex .
whispering I heard they just made out .
That &apos;s it .
Well , I heard they made out ... and had sex .
Don &apos;t talk about it .
Office romances are nobody &apos;s business but the people involved .
Romances ?
Pam , I have ideas on a daily basis .
I know I do .
I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas .
Um , is there any chance that you wrote any of my ideas down , like , in a folder ?
Like , a idea folder ?
Sorry .
That &apos;s unfortunate .
inhales deeply whispers How about the suggestion box ?
There &apos;s tons of ideas in there .
What suggestion box ?
The suggestion box that I put out , and people could put in suggestions anonymously .
Maybe there &apos;s prizes .
Oh , yeah .
Uh , I think I remember that from back when I first started .
Why don &apos;t you find it and then tell people to get theirs ?
Never mind .
I &apos;ll tell them .
Hello , everybody .
Yeah .
Uh , attention , please .
Jan Levinson &apos;s coming very soon .
And so we &apos;re going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting .
So you can all get in your constructive compliments ASAP .
Don &apos;t you mean constructive criticism ?
What did I say ?
You said constructive compliments .
That doesn &apos;t make any sense .
Well , Kelly , that was neither constructive nor a compliment , so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions .
Okay ?
Hey , Dan , this is Jim .
It is about 11 : 15 and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow , which is the 15th and that is a ... Saturday .
Saturday .
So just let me know what you &apos;re doing tomorrow , Saturday , for lunch .
Okay , talk to you soon .
So that &apos;s ... Uh-huh .
That &apos;s great .
Yes , it is .
Yeah .
You have fun ?
Yes , I did .
Did you ... go to first base ?
Hell , yeah .
Oh , yeah ?
Yeah .
Did you go to second ?
What ?
Second ?
Kind of , yeah .
Over the shirt .
My elbow , but .
Okay .
So close call on second .
Um ... exhales deeply Was there an infield fly ?
Um , yep .
Wait .
Yes .
Pop-up ?
No .
There--later , there was .
Really ?
Yes .
So you got the signal from the third base coach ?
chuckles You know what I &apos;m saying , like , if there was a , you know , a fly out to deep right .
Mm-hmm .
You know ?
A runner on second ?
You tagged up , didn &apos;t he ?
I didn &apos;t--you know , it was-- It was dark , for one thing .
Jan talking on phone Okay .
Okay , bye-bye .
flip phone clicks Would you please tell Michael that I &apos;m here ?
( Pam ) Sure .
Hi , Jan. How are you ?
Hi , Michael .
I &apos;m good .
How are you ?
Good to see you .
Nice to see you .
Okay .
Okay , why don &apos;t we just step into my off-- chuckles We &apos;re going to go in here .
Can we please go into your office ?
Yep .
Right after you .
Après vous .
exhales deeply Oh , thank you .
It &apos;s nice to see you .
Nice to see you too , Michael .
Really ?
Not like that .
Oh , well ... You know , Michael , I think I need to make something clear right off the top .
I &apos;m not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business .
All right .
Period .
Yup .
Do we understand each other ?
Absolutely .
I &apos;m a little confused because first it &apos;s , like , all kissy-kissy .
And then it &apos;s , like , all regret .
Because , &quot; Oh , I regret that .
&quot; But wait , I &apos;m still going to call you .
&quot; But--but we &apos;re just going to talk business .
&quot; And I may come down there and fire you if you don &apos;t do your job . &quot;
But what were we talking about when we first kissed ?
Business .
So are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then ?
No , no , no .
I finished all of that .
I &apos;m very fast .
I &apos;m not too fast .
Not like wham , bam , thank you , ma &apos;am .
But I do say thank you , ma &apos;am .
But I &apos;m not like , wham , bam .
Not that there &apos;s anything wrong with wham , bam .
If it &apos;s consensual .
We &apos;re talking about office stuff .
Can I ask you a question ?
No .
This is a business question .
It &apos;s nothing personal .
I promise .
Fine .
Are you wearing new perfume today ?
How is that a business question ?
Well , you &apos;re wearing it at the office .
And ... sniffs It ...
I &apos;m sorry , no offense , but it &apos;s really sexy .
Please don &apos;t smell me , Michael .
Hey , Jim .
Hey , how &apos;s it going ?
Oh , my God .
Did you seed The Apprentice last night ?
Of course .
It &apos;s on every Thursday night .
So how can I miss it ?
Can you believe who Trump fired ?
No .
That was unbelievable .
Who ?
Who was it ?
Who did he fire ?
You didn &apos;t see it ?
No .
I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night .
Crap .
I never go out on a Thursday night .
What the hell was I thinking ?
I don &apos;t understand-- phone rings Hold on .
Sorry .
Yes , Pam .
( Pam ) Michael , it &apos;s time for the suggestion box meeting .
I &apos;m kind of in the middle of something .
I wish you wouldn &apos;t interrupt .
You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here .
I did not--not--not use those words .
Uh , I &apos;d like to sit in on that meeting .
Is it happening right now ?
No , it &apos;s in , like , 10 minutes .
Everyone &apos;s waiting in the conference room .
sighs Great .
Very good .
What is this meeting for , again ?
( Dwight ) Do you want me to handle this ?
No , I do not .
Why are we here , Oscar ?
Because I value your opinions .
And know a lot of you don &apos;t think that I read your suggestions , but I do .
Every week , I comb through everything that you have to say and I value your comments .
I just thought it would be nice to do this together for a change .
You read our suggestions every week ?
More or less , yeah .
I do .
So let &apos;s take a look at these suckers , shall we ?
Oh , uh , question .
Do you want me to read them ?
No , I &apos;ll read them .
Okay .
Can I take them out of the box ?
I can take them out .
I &apos;ll take them out .
Can I hold the box ?
I &apos;ll hold the box .
Yeah , yeah , yeah .
Why don &apos;t you hold the box ?
You wanna hold the box ?
Please .
You happy ?
You finally happy ?
You gonna tell your stupid , Amish cousin that you live with that you got to hold a box today , you freakin &apos; monster ?
takes deep breath Let &apos;s read &apos; em .
All right .
Number one , what should we do to prepare for Y2K ?
What should we do to prepare for Y2K ?
I thought you read these every week .
Well , obviously , this one got stuck in the box .
That happens occasionally .
( Dwight ) It happens occasionally .
And , um , so one down .
Next suggestion .
&quot; We need better outreach for employees fighting depression . &quot;
Okay , all right .
Enough with the jokes .
Nobody in here is suffering from depression .
That sounds serious , Michael .
Oh .
Okay .
Well , yeah ?
Who wrote it ?
Tom .
Tom .
Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom .
( Phyllis ) Tom ?
He worked in accounting up until about a year ago .
whispers Tom .
imitates gunshot Oh , that guy ?
That guy was weird .
All right , next suggestion .
Next suggestion .
Ar , badoo badoo .
You need to do something about your B.O.
You need to do something about your B.O.
Okay , now I don &apos;t know who this suggestion is meant for , but it &apos;s more of a personal suggestion .
And it &apos;s not an office suggestion .
Far be it from me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody .
Aren &apos;t the suggestions meant for you ?
Well , Toby , if by me you are inferring that I have B.O. , then I would say that that is a very poor choice of words .
Uh , Michael , he wasn &apos;t inferring , he was implying .
You were inferring .
Was I , Creed ?
Okay , well , you know what ?
I am implying is that when we &apos;re on an elevator together , I should maybe take the stairs because talk about stank .
Not that I would ever say something like that in public and I never have and I never will , I just think it &apos;s something that we should all be aware of .
Okay ?
scoffs Now that we &apos;ve learned this , let &apos;s continue .
See , this is good .
We &apos;re learning , and we &apos;re figuring some stuff out .
You need to do something about your coffee breath .
You need to do something about-- Okay , no .
Shut up , shut up .
shut up , Dwight .
Okay , I don &apos;t think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box .
Sometimes , you talk to us real close .
Yeah ?
Is that hard for you ?
All right .
Well , when you have coffee breath , it &apos;s hard .
Let &apos;s k-- let &apos;s keep going .
Yup .
What do we have here ?
We have ... somebody &apos;s piece of gum .
Somebody put a piece of gum in there .
This is not a--a garbage can , this is the future of our company .
This is not a place for gum , okay ?
I don &apos;t want to have to read these tomorrow ... Yeah , who wants to come in on a Saturday ?
Yeah .
What ?
No .
Okay .
Let &apos;s just--let &apos;s just push on , shall we ?
Pushing on .
Just gimme the next two .
Let &apos;s just keep it going .
Look on the supply shelf .
What ?
What is that ?
All right , um , Ryan , look on the supply shelf , would you ?
Yeah .
It &apos;s another note .
Okay .
Look on the windshield .
Okay .
Does it specify which windshield ?
I &apos;ll check them all .
sighs ( Dwight ) This ought to be good .
( Stanley ) Which one ?
( Dwight ) There it is !
Where ?
It &apos;s on the black one .
He doesn &apos;t see it .
( Stanley ) It &apos;s right there .
It &apos;s on the Miata !
He sees it .
( Dwight ) Go--okay , he &apos;s got it .
What does it say ?
Look under the sink in the men &apos;s room !
What I try to do with these people ... sighs Is get them to--to be honest like that whole coffee breath thing .
That &apos;s good , that &apos;s good , You know what ?
I drink a lot of coffee .
And it &apos;s not saying that I have bad breath , it &apos;s just saying-- Frankly , I think that this entire meeting is a bit of a waste of time , Michael .
Well , we haven &apos;t finished yet .
We &apos;ve now been here 15 minutes .
Right .
We &apos;ve just been sitting here doing this .
Come on back , come on back .
These needless suggestions .
( Michael ) Well , we just have a couple more .
All right , don &apos;t break any land speed records getting back .
Okay , Stanley ?
All right .
Next suggestion .
Next suggestion .
Don &apos;t-- Okay , that &apos;s blank .
Don &apos;t--just-- Don &apos;t sleep with your boss .
Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan ?
Okay , let me-- let me make something clear .
As embarrassing as this is , I feel that it needs to be said .
There is nothing romantic or--or sexual going on with Michael and myself .
Well-- The other night , I gave him a polite , congratulatory kiss because he just closed the biggest deal of his-- his career and--and-- and that &apos;s it .
Okay ?
If anything else has been inferred or implied , it &apos;s just not true .
So .
Is everyone straight on that ?
Crystal .
There &apos;s one more suggestion .
Press it .
You can , um-- Way to go , man .
Jan &apos;s really hot .
Okay , I think we &apos;re good .
I can &apos;t--I can &apos;t-- I don &apos;t understand why you &apos;re so upset .
All right , please sit down .
I &apos;m going to sit over here .
You &apos;re going to sit over there .
Let me ask you this .
Please sit yourself down .
Let me ask you something .
What , Michael ?
Where did you get your outfit ?
groans What is an office ?
Is it a group of people ?
Maybe .
Is it an idea ?
Of course , yes .
Is it a living organism ?
Exactly .
Yes .
And any single-cell organism has to have a spine , and that &apos;s me .
But the spine is always controlled by a brain , and that is Jan.
But the brain needs a heart , and that is me again .
chuckling So ironic .
You know what ?
The heart is smarter than the brain .
clock ticking But the brain is so effin &apos; hot .
Oh , my God .
When Dwight said that no one wants to come in on Saturday ?
Pam .
I almost lost it .
chuckling That was too good .
Well , that is because that is the gift that keeps on giving .
( Pam ) laughing quietly Oh , my God .
I left today &apos;s paper on my desk .
You mean yesterday &apos;s paper .
What ?
Yes .
That is exactly what I mean .
Whoa .
You are very good at what you do .
Thank you .
chewing loudly Hey , temp .
Hey .
Look , we &apos;re twins .
Huh .
chuckles Cool .
Bet you I got mine for less than yours .
I bet you did .
Mm , getting a little something to calm the nerves ?
What nerves ?
For the performance review .
Oh , wait .
You don &apos;t get one .
You &apos;re a temp .
Ha-ha .
chuckles politely Actually , I had mine already .
You &apos;re lying .
Why would I lie about a performance review ?
Why would Michael give you one before me ?
I think because my name is before yours in alphabetical order .
change clanking sighs How did it go ?
Fine .
He actually gave me a small raise , which I did not ask for .
vending machine grinds It &apos;s stuck .
chip bag crackling It &apos;s cool .
It fell .
It &apos;s-- Motley Crue &apos;s &quot; Wild Side &quot; playing on cheap stereo You &apos;re gonna give me this raise .
I deserve this raise .
Yes .
Yes !
Yes !
Ha !
The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation .
Kah-ah !
Yes !
Why are you going to give me this raise ?
Why ?
( Motley Crue ) Kneel down , you sinners Because I &apos;m awesome !
I am awesome !
( Motley Crue ) Wild side sighs I just don &apos;t understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened .
Because nothing did , Michael .
I &apos;m not going to say anything more about it , and I would advise that you do the same .
Look-- Michael .
Oh , my God .
I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m interrupting ?
Oh , God .
Were you guys making out ?
No , Dwight .
Come in .
Great .
What do you want , Dwight ?
I am ready for my performance review .
Okay .
Great .
Your performance has been adequate .
You may leave .
Good-bye .
Is this how you &apos;ve been conducting all the reviews , Michael ?
You want to talk now ?
Good .
Okay , Dwight , leave .
Uh , wait .
I would like to discuss my raise .
Why on Earth would we give you a raise ?
That is an excellent question .
Thank you for asking .
Let me bring up one word .
Dedication .
I have never ... been late .
Also , I have never missed a day due to illness .
sighs Even when I had walking pneumonia .
I even come in on holidays .
You do ?
How do you get in ?
I have a copy of your key .
That &apos;s a serious offense .
That is a serious offense .
Very serious .
shakily As is toying with a man &apos;s heart .
Oh , Michael , for God sakes .
I &apos;d also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace .
Okay , third wheel , why don &apos;t you do that ?
For instance , the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office .
That was deer ?
Gross .
Oh ... You liked it .
God .
Did not .
Jan , have you ever had deer ?
No .
It &apos;s a delicacy .
And you know what ?
It &apos;s an aphrodisiac .
So when we &apos;re done here , you guys could go over to the Antler Lodge , sample some deer , and talk about my raise .
What do you say , Jan ?
Okay .
Here &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
I &apos;m going to step outside , collect my thoughts , and I will return in about 10 minutes .
Okay , you just , uh , clear your head .
Thank you , Dwight .
door slams Look , I know it &apos;s your job , I know you have to ask , but I promise you , I &apos;m not going to discuss it with him .
I &apos;m certainly not going to discuss it with you .
Do you have a light ?
And in conclusion , I think Lex Luthor said it best when he said , &quot; Dad , you have no idea what I &apos;m capable of . &quot;
That &apos;s from Superman ?
Smallville .
And that is why I feel I deserve this raise .
There &apos;s never a good time to ask for a raise .
You just have to go for it .
Maybe they were making out .
Yeah , that got a little out of control .
inhales deeply Jan &apos;s taking a break , which is fine .
I &apos;m doing the same .
Just chillin &apos; .
Get my mind off of us .
She &apos;s right , I need to be more professional at the office .
When I &apos;m at work , I need to focus on work .
I should call her ex-husband .
Yes , hello .
Is this R. Gould ?
Hi .
Uh , my name is Michael Scott .
I work at Dunder-Mifflin with your wife , Jan-- ex-wife , Jan. Yeah , that &apos;s me .
Um , I had a question .
Uh , I was wondering whether I could ask something sort of personal about your wife-- ex-wife ?
Okay .
Or can I ask anyway ?
Well , I &apos;m just gonna ask .
When you guys were dating , was she sort of easy to get and then sort of hard to get ?
Okay .
Yeah , that Gould is a real interesting guy .
What a gem .
inhales deeply I can see why he and Jan are no longer together .
If--if my conversation with him is any measure of their relationship , he was verbally abusive , he was curt , he was , uh , he had an inability to communicate , shall I say ?
He was emotionally unavailable .
I don &apos;t--I don &apos;t know how she dealt with that as long as she did .
( Pam ) Do you think Michael and Jan actually ...
I don &apos;t really want to picture it , but thank you , Pam .
How do you come back from that ?
Um , you don &apos;t , I don &apos;t think , come all the way back , you know .
Especially working together .
No , I mean , doing that with Michael .
How do you come back from that ?
Oh .
As a human being ?
Yeah , no .
I don &apos;t think you can .
Office romances ?
Um ... chuckles I think you should probably ask Pam .
&apos;Cause she &apos;s in an office romance .
Technically .
Look under the suggestion box .
I can &apos;t believe I kept this up all day .
Signed , me .
I &apos;m heading back to New York .
Allan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow , okay ?
Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
No , no .
I just--I just want to know why .
Michael , now is not the time or the place .
Okay .
So you &apos;re saying that there is a different time ... No .
Or place that we can have this discussion ?
I am saying we are never gonna have this conversation .
Well , okay .
What , never as in never ever ever ?
Or never as in there &apos;s no chance ?
( Jan ) Never for me always means never ever ever .
Well , then , Gould wasn &apos;t kidding .
What ?
sighs Nothing .
What did you say , Michael ?
I just--exhales deeply Nothing .
Did you call my ex ?
No , I did not .
Gould ?
You said Gould .
Maybe I did .
Maybe I called him .
I don &apos;t know .
How dare you , Michael .
My personal life is off-limits to you , okay ?
I &apos;m-- How dare you do that ?
I didn &apos;t do that .
I--maybe he called me .
Why would he do that ?
Why would he call you , Michael ?
Why would my husband call you ?
Ex-husband .
I mean-- You have to let it go .
I just want to know from the horse &apos;s mouth what is the dealio .
You know , Michael ... Am I too short ?
Michael , it has nothing to do with your looks , okay ?
It &apos;s your-- it &apos;s your personality .
I mean , you &apos;re obnoxious and rude and--and--and ... stupid .
And you do have coffee breath , by the way .
And--and I don &apos;t agree about the B.O. , But you are very , very inconsiderate .
Really ?
Really .
You &apos;re--you &apos;re--you &apos;re ... you &apos;re a great guy , okay ?
I appreciate that .
Thank you .
You were very sweet .
And you stayed up with me and talked to me and cried with me and I appreciate that in this difficult time in my life .
No , I wasn &apos;t .
I wasn &apos;t crying .
( Jan ) But I am just not in the place right now where I &apos;m looking for a relationship .
So we can still work together , we can still be friends , but ... elevator bell rings Okay ?
So my looks having nothing to do with it .
exhaling deeply Oh , God .
( Michael ) Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now , and it doesn &apos;t matter how great a guy I am .
And that is all I needed .
I &apos;m good .
I can go home now .
phone ringing Hey , it &apos;s 12 : 20 .
Where the hell is Dwight ?
Um , no idea .
Never missed a day , my ass .
phone ringing chuckles softly phone ringing I &apos;m here !
I &apos;m here !
I &apos;m here !
It &apos;s okay !
It is Friday morning , and it is another beautiful day in Scranton , Pennsylvania .
Oh , oh , my God .
Oh !
dialing telephone Pick up , pick up , pick up , pick up .
Oh , we have a serious problem here .
All right , everybody , lock the doors .
Turn off the lights .
Pretend you &apos;re not here .
Are we in danger ?
There &apos;s no time to think about it .
This is real .
Just shh , everybody .
knock at door ( Kevin ) Michael , should I call the-- What ?
The I.T.
tech guy and me did not get off to a great start .
soft piano music You &apos;re going to have to stop that .
I can still feel it .
Yeah , I tried to install it myself , but you guys have these things so password-protected .
That just means you have to enter your password .
Uh ... What &apos;s your password , Michael ?
Um , it &apos;s-- Oh , 1234 .
Yes .
typing on keyboard Do you have a question or something ?
Mm , I don &apos;t think so .
About my turban maybe ?
Nope , nope .
I actually wear a turban sometimes .
You wanna see it ?
I got it here .
Why do you have that ?
Comedy .
It &apos;s funny .
It &apos;s--Johnny Carson , Carnac .
It &apos;s , um ...
It is ... sighs Did you have Johnny Carson in your land ?
In Pittsburgh ?
Yeah , but I never really watched him .
Oh .
You were forbidden .
No , I &apos;m much younger than you .
I watch Conan .
All right , I &apos;m gonna-- uh , I &apos;m gonna get a cup of coffee .
Do you want some coffee or some ... No .
Tea or hummus or something ?
No , thank you .
Michael-- Aah !
Gah !
Sorry .
Please don &apos;t do that .
Okay , I &apos;m sorry .
What is going on in there ?
Why is he here ?
What are you doing ?
I can &apos;t tell you .
You have to tell me .
I don &apos;t have to tell you anything .
Look , Michael .
I know you don &apos;t want to have to think about this , but if something were to happen to you , God forbid , then I would need to know in order to take over .
Dwight , nothing is gonna happen to me .
Okay ?
I &apos;m in the best shape of my life .
Look at at this .
Grr !
Yeah , but that doesn &apos;t matter .
You could get a brain aneurysm .
I &apos;m not gonna-- Or hit by a car .
Stop .
Or a bus or a train .
Or get poisoned .
Fall down a well .
Step on a mine .
Choke .
Okay , if I step on a mine in Scranton , Pennsylvania and die , you can have my job .
Okay ?
Why don &apos;t you just go away ?
There are certain things a boss does not share with his employees .
His salary .
That would depress them .
His bed .
It-- And I am not going to tell them that I &apos;ll be reading their emails .
Email surveillance .
All the big companies are doing it now .
It increases productivity .
It increases efficiency .
It is a necessary evil .
Well , not evil .
It &apos;s a good necessary good thing to ... do .
So how do you search ?
By keyword phrase .
Try &quot; profits . &quot;
No , try &quot; Michael Scott . &quot;
&quot; Michael , &quot; &quot; boss , &quot; and &quot; funny . &quot;
typing on keyboard Oh , my God !
Wow !
chuckles Email from Stanley .
Stanley .
Terribly nice guy .
&quot; Sorry I didn &apos;t write back sooner .
&quot; I can &apos;t go to the game tonight &quot; because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late . &quot;
Well , Stanley &apos;s an ass .
Not one of our harder workers .
clears throat Oh , this isn &apos;t good .
It &apos;s fine .
You don &apos;t even know what I &apos;m talking about .
Hey , what &apos;s the deal , Michael ?
Why are you spying on our computers ?
Oh , no !
Everybody , Oscar &apos;s gone crazy .
What other ghost stories do you have for us ?
That I bugged the office ?
That I &apos;ve put cameras in the plants ?
That I &apos;m a robot ?
chuckles robotic voice I will destroy everything in my path .
Actually , we just-- Boop !
Beep !
Bop !
Okay .
Bonk !
Boop , boop .
Oil can .
Oil can .
( Oscar ) Tin Man .
Actually we just got a memo from I.T.
saying you &apos;re doing email surveillance .
Oh , what ?
No , that defeats the whole purpose .
So it &apos;s true ?
You have access to our emails ?
Yes , yes , yes , but it &apos;s no big deal .
I mean , a lot of growing companies-- We &apos;re growing ?
I thought we were worried about downsizing .
Yes , we are not growing in terms of people or jobs , but we are growing together as a company .
We &apos;re growing stronger , and we &apos;re growing better into a more-- into a more united company .
Yeah , one where our boss spies on us .
I hear you , Stanley .
I do .
And you know what the problem is ?
I think I do .
The problem is that when people hear the term &quot; Big Brother , &quot; they immediately think it &apos;s scary or bad , but I don &apos;t , I think , &quot; Wow .
I love my Big Brother .
He &apos;s handsome , and he &apos;s fit , and he &apos;s a good guy . &quot;
&quot; And he has a lot of helpful suggestions . &quot;
Like , here &apos;s a helpful suggestion for Jim .
Jim , instead of emailing Amazon to try to get that CD that you didn &apos;t receive , I suggest that you go to Visa and tell &apos; em to cancel the charge .
Yeah , definitely didn &apos;t need help with that , but , yeah .
It seems like you did though , Jim .
Oh .
Lots of emails to Amazon .
Lots of wasted computer space .
All right , let &apos;s get back to work .
Yeah , I assumed Michael was already doing this .
That &apos;s why I only use my personal email account .
I wonder if I could get that software .
My fiancée &apos;s been acting funny .
This whole email thing could be bad for business .
I mean my business .
I have a side job where I do people &apos;s taxes .
I gotta erase a lot of stuff .
A lotof stuff .
Oh , hey , just so you know , if you have any sensitive emails , they need to be deleted immediately .
I know .
Good .
whispering Hey .
Something just happened .
Dwight just told Angela that she has to delete all of her sensitive emails immediately .
What ?
I know .
Hmm .
Do you think that they &apos;re like-- No .
Right , no .
Ugh !
Ew .
Ew , ew , ew .
Maybe .
It &apos;s like squishing a spider under a book .
It &apos;s gonna be really gross , but I have to look and make sure that it &apos;s really dead .
So if you guys see anything ... Hey , Dwight ?
Um ... My friend is kind of into these two girls that he works with .
Nice .
One is tall and brunette .
And the other one is short and blonde and perky and kind of judgmental .
Who do you think he should choose ?
Does he have access to their medical records ?
Um ...
I think one of the greatest things about modern America is the computerization of medical records .
As a volunteer sheriff , I can look up anyone &apos;s psychiatric records or surgical histories .
Yeast infections .
There are a huge number of yeast infections in this county .
Probably because we &apos;re down river from that old bread factory .
keyboard clacking Should &apos;ve done this a long time ago .
Tons of personal emails .
Huge time wasters .
Ugh .
chuckles Oh .
Wow , like , Kevin rating the best bars in Scranton .
Poor Richard &apos;s number seven .
Ugh , idiot .
Stupid load .
phone rings Yeah .
( Pam ) Hey , Michael .
Accounting needs your approval on-- No , I &apos;m busy right now .
( Michael ) Meredith has an Evite from Jim .
&quot; Barbecue at Jim &apos;s tonight . &quot;
Tonight .
Wonder where my &quot; e-vitation &quot; is ?
Click on guest list .
Angela , Stanley , Oscar , Meredith , Phyllis , Kevin , Creed .
Must be ... mouse clicking No .
phone ringing This is Pam .
No , Pam , you have to keep your eye on the prize .
You need to keep your eye on the horrible , horrible prize .
Yahtzee .
( Pam ) Oh .
sighs Ooh , bleh , bleh , bleh .
Where &apos;s your tie ?
I don &apos;t know .
Just felt like taking it off .
Man , work can be just so damn frustrating .
Don &apos;t you think , Jim ?
Um , yeah , I guess .
What &apos;s going on , Michael ?
Talk to me .
Eh , you know , same old stuff .
Same old , you know .
Boss just been riding my ass .
Oh , no , Jan ?
What &apos;s going on ?
( Michael ) I don &apos;t want to talk about it .
You know , just want to hang out , just be one of the guys .
( Dwight ) The most important one of the guys .
( Michael ) That &apos;s not the point .
Just-- That &apos;s exactly the point .
You &apos;ve hit a slump .
It happens to the best of us .
sighs You just have to remember , you know , where you come from and who you are .
Okay .
You know , you have worked so hard for this .
You are the boss .
You can buy and sell us with just a snap of your little finger .
Yes , well , I would never do that .
Yeah , no one can snap with their little finger .
Jim , this is hardly the time .
No , this is completely the time .
This is the perfect time .
This is just guys gently ribbing each other .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s all about .
Hanging out .
Enjoying friends .
All being the same .
Worker bees .
And their king bee .
( Michael ) No , just bees .
Just bees hanging out .
Buzzing around .
( Dwight ) The master bee .
I am not a master bee .
( Dwight ) Queen bee .
I &apos;m just a bee , Dwight , okay ?
Just a bee .
Just buzzing .
Hey , Angela .
How &apos;s it going ?
It &apos;s okay .
Listen , are you bringing anyone to Jim &apos;s party tonight ?
No .
Are we supposed to ?
No .
I mean , I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t think so .
Hmm .
Excuse me .
Oh .
There &apos;s always a distance between a boss and the employees .
It is just nature &apos;s rule .
It &apos;s intimidation mostly .
It &apos;s the awareness that they are not me .
You see , they &apos;re thinking , &quot; Wow , Michael Scott .
I really respect him .
&quot; What &apos;ll I do if I drop spinach dip on him &quot; at a party ?
What is he gonna think of me ?
&quot; What--is it gonna affect my salary ?
Ooh , Michael Scott . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t know .
I do think that I am very approachable as one of the guys .
laughs But maybe I need to be even &quot; approachabler . &quot;
clears throat That &apos;s pretty , um-- Yeah .
Are you gonna eat with us ?
Of course .
Hanging with my crew .
Crew that I am one of .
Hanging with my cup of noodles .
This is a meal in a cup right here .
Hot , tasty .
Ah , man .
So how &apos;s your day been so far-- I &apos;m sorry this is so late .
Oh .
There was a big order right before yours , but they threw in a free spicy tuna roll , so-- You know what ?
I don &apos;t need that .
I got my lunch .
What ?
I got my lunch .
I &apos;m good , I &apos;m good .
You don &apos;t want this ?
No .
You know , why don &apos;t you keep it ?
Tell you what , better yet , put it in the fridge and put my name on it .
Thanks .
I got my cup of noodles Mmm .
Reminds me of college .
Lived on this stuff .
Brain food .
Mmm .
You know what I really , really miss about college ?
The parties .
Everybody &apos;d go .
The athletes , the nerds , professors .
The professors would go to the parties ?
Yeah .
They were the most fun .
We always invited them .
( Jim ) It &apos;s true .
I &apos;m having a party .
I &apos;ve got three cases of imported beer , karaoke machine , and I didn &apos;t invite Michael .
So three ingredients for a great party .
And it &apos;s nothing personal .
I just think that if he were there , people wouldn &apos;t be able to relax , you know , have fun .
And my roommate wants to meet everybody because I &apos;m pretty sure he thinks I &apos;m making Dwight up .
He is very real .
Hi .
Hey , babe , hey .
Hey .
How are you ?
Good .
You look good .
Thank you .
Hey , um , I was wondering if it might be okay if I go to Lonny &apos;s poker game tonight .
I promise it &apos;ll be , like , the last time for a while .
We &apos;re supposed to go to the barbecue at Jim &apos;s house .
Oh , man .
Um , could you go without me ?
Make something up ?
Say I ate something or-- sighs Huh ?
Huh ?
You &apos;re the best .
You &apos;re the best .
I might be late .
Okay , don &apos;t wake me up &apos; cause I &apos;m playing ball in the morning .
Okay .
All right , bye .
Did I miss anything ?
Hey , Jim .
What &apos;s up , Kev ?
Hey , um , I know it &apos;s kind of last minute , but I was wondering if it would be cool if I brought my fiancée tonight .
Oh , yeah , totally .
It &apos;s totally casual , so not really worried about numbers or whatever .
Cool .
All right ?
Thanks .
Yeah , definitely .
What ?
Oh .
Yes !
Thank you .
Question .
On the Internet , there are several different options to get to your house for the party tonight .
-Oh , uh , no , no .
-And I was wondering-- No , no , no .
Keep that down .
Why ?
Because not everybody knows about the party .
Like who ?
Who doesn &apos;t know ?
Um , Michael .
Why just Michael ?
Because it &apos;s a surprise .
Is it ?
Mm-hmm .
Oh , that &apos;s perfect .
So don &apos;t tell .
I won &apos;t .
Okay .
So Dwight thinks that tonight is a surprise party for Michael .
Really ?
That &apos;s great .
I know .
Maybe we can get him to hide and wait somewhere .
chuckles Oh , man .
Oh , you know what ?
Speaking of which , I was just trying to get a handle on , you know , numbers and-- for food and stuff , so do you think Roy &apos;s gonna come or-- Oh , no .
He can &apos;t make it .
Oh , okay .
Cool .
Hey there .
Hey .
Almost quitting time .
Yep .
It &apos;s 4 : 00 .
One more hour to take care of anything you forgot to do .
clears throat Hey , you know , I don &apos;t know if you have any plans tonight , but if you don &apos;t , we could hang out .
Oh , um ... I can &apos;t .
You have plans ?
Mm-hmm , yeah , I do .
Yeah , I do too , I do too .
Oh , you do ?
Big plans .
I do , yeah .
Because you just said that you wanted to hang out-- Tonight , I can &apos;t do it tonight .
No .
Improv class .
I have improv class .
Hanging out with my improv buds .
Really ?
Yeah .
Oh , that sounds like a lot of fun .
Oh , it &apos;s the best .
It is the best .
I would not miss it for the world , but if something else came up , I would definitely not go .
Improv sounds great .
It is .
Okay .
All right .
Stanley coughs What ?
I think Stanley just coughed .
5 : 00 .
Time to go get my improv on .
Little bit of the comedy juice .
Mmm , all right , see if you can guess what this is .
growling That is a dinosaur getting ready to go to improv class .
Just a taste of the improv .
Hey , Pam , do you need me to walk you to your vehicular transport ?
No , thanks .
All right .
Oscar , do you have big plans tonight-- I &apos;m on a call .
Okay .
Kevin , big man , big man , what are you doing tonight ?
Where you off to ?
My brother is in town , and we are going to see the Alaska Film Festival at-- Okay , all right .
Oh .
Hey , Angela .
Rushy , rushy .
Where you rushing off to ?
I &apos;m just leaving for the day .
Yeah , well , duh .
Where you headed ?
Charity .
Bake Drive .
Liar !
No !
You are a liar .
No , I &apos;m not !
sighs Dwight .
Oh , Dwight , my loyal compadre .
You and I are hanging tonight .
The two of us .
We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood .
You know what ?
Why don &apos;t we watch that show you &apos;ve been wanting to watch ?
That stupid Battleship Galaxy-- Battlestar Galactica ?
That &apos;s--whatever stupid show you want to watch .
I can &apos;t tonight .
Unfortunately , I &apos;ve got plans .
I have to go to practice .
Soccer practice .
I didn &apos;t know you played soccer , Dwight .
Clarinet .
You too , Dwight ?
Have fun tonight .
Whatever it is that you &apos;re doing .
And I &apos;ll see you Monday .
whispering He has no idea .
soft rock music Quick announcement , everybody .
If I could have everybody &apos;s attention .
We do have wine in the kitchen , and there is beer available on the porch , and despite what you might think , it &apos;s not all for Meredith and Kelly , so please enjoy .
Jim , you really think this is a good idea ?
Huh ?
A hide-a-key rock ?
Hey , you must be Dwight .
You don &apos;t work with us .
That &apos;s because Mark &apos;s my roommate .
Oh .
So ... Hey , I love the Birkenstocks .
Thanks .
Yeah , I always keep an extra set in the car for special occasions .
Jim , come here .
Mm-hmm ?
When is the guest of honor coming ?
Oh .
Uh , later-ish .
He &apos;s gonna love it !
Great .
I just wanted to let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-- Hey .
Hey !
Just in time .
Do you want to go on a group tour ?
-We were just about to leave .
-Definitely .
Well , the group tour is now leaving then .
Ladies and gentlemen , just a few things that we &apos;re gonna be pointing out to you today .
You will be able to see both bedrooms , and if we &apos;re lucky , maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom .
Who knows ?
I have to remind you also that flash photography is prohibited .
And as much as you can , please refrain from touching things .
I know you might want to .
Hey , is Katie coming ?
Um , actually I haven &apos;t talked to her in a while .
Huh ?
Oh .
Is it cool if I call her ?
( Jim ) We can talk about that later .
Watch me enter my comfort zone .
Ah , they can &apos;t even start without me .
Hello !
Okay , let &apos;s get right into it .
I need two people for the first scene .
Ooh , ooh , ooh !
Mr. Kotter !
Mr. Kotter !
Okay .
Michael .
And ...
Anybody ?
How about Marybeth ?
Okay .
Come on .
Okay , so you start us off , Marybeth .
All right , great .
La la la la la Boom !
Detective Michael Scarn !
I &apos;m with the FBI !
Think about this .
What is the most exciting thing that can happen on TV or in movies or in real life ?
Somebody has a gun .
That &apos;s why I always start with a gun because you can &apos;t top it .
You just can &apos;t .
Okay , Bill , why don &apos;t you start us off ?
And I want you guys to jump in when you have an idea , all right ?
Okay , so let &apos;s start him up .
applause Thirsty .
So incredibly thirsty .
Welcome to the Sahara Desert Latte Hut .
Would you like to try a green iced tea blended ?
students chuckle Just water .
Uh , I &apos;m supposed to meet my doctor here .
Have you seen him ?
He &apos;s a very angry midget .
Boom !
Freeze !
Michael Scoon , FBI !
You know what you did .
Boom , boom , boom !
Yeah , you thought you could get away with your little ruse didn &apos;t you ?
Didn &apos;t you ?
Well , you didn &apos;t .
Because I know where you hid the diamonds .
I &apos;ve been onto you and your little friends for weeks .
Boom , boom , boom !
I &apos;m not even in the scene !
-Boom , boom , boom !
-Stop , okay , stop .
Stop !
They &apos;re not--stop !
-Boom !
-Okay , you shot me .
-Great .
Stop .
-What ?
Okay , you can &apos;t just shoot everyone in the scene .
Well , if you hadn &apos;t stopped the scene , you would &apos;ve seen where it was going .
Okay , what about the scene they set up ?
Boring .
No , it wasn &apos;t .
No more guns .
-Could &apos;ve-- - No , no .
Michael , I want you to give me all the guns you have .
Just get rid of all your guns and give them to me .
Great .
Bleh !
Bleh .
Okay .
So if you just step into this room , uh , yeah , look around .
You might find a few clues about who lives here .
He likes biking , obviously , and what else ?
Uh , he likes tour guides , I guess , and if you &apos;re very perceptive , you &apos;ll notice that he didn &apos;t do a great job cleaning his room .
Okay , and that &apos;s the to-- And he &apos;s really into penguins or something ?
Um , thank you , Ryan .
Uh , no , I don &apos;t know .
I think I made the mistake one day of telling someone I liked penguins , and here we are .
I &apos;m sorry .
I gave you that penguin .
And that &apos;s why it &apos;s on my desk , Phyllis .
It means a lot to me , and now that I know it &apos;s from you , it means even more .
Moving on .
Okay , for the next exercise , let &apos;s everyone pair up .
claps ( improv teacher ) Partner and ... everybody got somebody ?
-Uh-huh .
-Okay , good .
Um , okay .
Nobody ever wants to fight the heavyweight champ .
Nobody wants that title shot .
I &apos;ll just throw in some suggestions .
( improv teacher ) Okay , you guys want to start ?
Don &apos;t throw in any suggestions .
-They &apos;re in a whorehouse ... -Okay .
We don &apos;t need a suggestion for this one .
-And he &apos;s a proctologist .
-Okay .
This one &apos;s gonna come from them .
This one &apos;s gonna come from them .
A game called Yes , And .
And you will say the first sentence .
You &apos;re telling a story-- First sentence is , &quot; I am a proctologist . &quot;
We &apos;re not gonna get a suggestion on this one .
It &apos;s gonna come from them , okay ?
Jim &apos;s bedroom .
See , I knew we lost somebody on the tour .
Cool .
This is your desk .
This is my desk .
Your home office .
Home office .
This is it .
Yeah .
You have to sit down so I can get the full effect .
Okay , sure .
Will do .
Okay , wait .
So that would make me ... Like right here .
Yeah , yep , that feels about right .
And then Dwight would be like-- Um , you know what ?
Let &apos;s just leave that image out of it because this is a happy place .
Happy thoughts , Pam .
Happy thoughts .
Um ... gasps Yearbook .
Yeah , you don &apos;t have to , um-- All right .
Yes , that &apos;s not gonna be awkward at all .
laughs Oh , no !
Oh , yeah .
You were so dorky !
Thank you .
laughs ( improv teacher ) Freeze .
I &apos;m in .
Do you want to go over the rules one more time ?
No , no , no , no .
I &apos;m looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune .
I promise it &apos;s worth it .
Ooh , I can see you walking out of here , and you &apos;re thrilled with your reading .
class chuckles What are you-- whispering Michael , what did you tell him ?
Nothing .
Then why are his hands up ?
Bill ?
He told me he couldn &apos;t show it to me , but he has a gun .
Okay .
Let &apos;s call it a day .
Nice job .
Good .
That was good .
Good work , everybody .
Improv &apos;s hit or miss .
Last week I was on fire .
Just Robin Williams , Ali G , Ryan Stiles , nailing it .
Home runs every-- every swing of the bat .
Um , this week , I was paired up with some pretty lame people , so you have to deal with that .
&quot; Whose Line Is It Anyway ? &quot;
It &apos;s Michael Scott &apos;s line &apos; cause , generally , Michael Scott &apos;s is the funniest line .
Hey , I love that playhouse .
Oh , yeah , thanks , belongs to the owners .
Mm , I &apos;d love to get one like that .
-Oh , yeah ?
-Yeah .
Interesting .
Totally forgot you had a kid .
Sorry about that .
Interesting .
Angela .
Burger , dog ?
Having fun ?
I got sap on me .
Chicken , hot dog , burger ?
I &apos;m a vegetarian .
-There &apos;s soda inside .
-Ugh .
I didn &apos;t think the premium laser color copy batch would sell as well as it did .
It surprised us all .
I &apos;ll tell you why .
-Because-- -I &apos;m sorry , guys .
Can we please not talk about paper ?
There &apos;s gotta be something else that we could talk about .
clears throat mellow music playing ( Angela ) Um , I think it &apos;s all right .
I mean , Jesus drank wine .
( Pam ) Hmm .
Hey , Phyllis .
Come here for a second .
Sure .
Have you heard anything about any secret office romances or-- You tell me .
Well , you do mean you and Jim , right ?
Oh , God .
I am so sorry .
I mean , I thought-- you guys hang out all the time , and you &apos;re talking all the time , and I-- I &apos;m sorry .
It &apos;s like-- Oh , it &apos;s okay .
It &apos;s okay .
Why don &apos;t you turn it up ?
Ah !
Not so fast , fire guy .
Think we need some more heat , fire guy ?
Hey , fire guy , maybe we should burn Jim &apos;s house down .
That &apos;s really funny .
Hey , Kelly , I called him fire guy .
Good one , Kev .
Yeah .
Hey , Stanley-- He called me fire guy .
Oh , good one .
chuckles It never gets old .
Never gets old .
How do we get to Bernie &apos;s Tavern from here ?
Oh , don &apos;t worry .
We &apos;re all gonna carpool .
So Bernie &apos;s , huh ?
We &apos;re all going to Bernie &apos;s ?
Oh , uh , sorry .
We &apos;re not going as a group .
It &apos;s just a private friend who happens to know all of us from different ways is throwing a private birthday thing .
Right , right , right , right , well , guys , I &apos;d love to go to Bernie &apos;s with you , but you know what ?
I have an office party .
Big office party I need to go to .
-Okay , see you next week .
-Can &apos;t get out of it .
Good job .
Hey , see you later .
Nice job , Bill .
Not .
Here I go again on my own rock music playing Going down the only road I &apos;ve ever known Oh , hey , how &apos;s your new side project going ?
Um , oh , yeah .
I gave that up .
Really ?
Yeah , it turns out I was , um , just grasping at straws .
Just because two people are hanging out , it doesn &apos;t mean that they &apos;re together .
You know ?
Like , people can just be friends .
And I think that it was really unfair of us to assume that there was anything else going on .
Just turn around now &apos; Cause you &apos;re not welcome anymore And I-- And I &apos;ve got-- Surprise !
laughs Everybody .
Wow , who opened the morgue for this thing ?
I was just driving by .
Thought I &apos;d drop in .
There &apos;s some wine .
I would love a glass if you &apos;re gonna open it .
Hello , temp .
Take my jacket .
laughs Oh , come on .
That guy ?
He is a good guy , not a terrorist .
Yikes .
Karaoke .

Need somebody else .
Takers , please .
Baby , when I met you there was peace unknown Kelly ?
I tried to get you with a fine tooth comb I was soft inside There was something going on This is the part that goes to the girl .
high-pitched You do something to me That I can &apos;t explain Hold me closer and I feel no pain Every beat of my heart We &apos;ve got something going on Tender love is blind singing together It requires a dedication All this love we feel needs no conversation Divide it together , uh-huh Making love with each other , uh-huh We &apos;re making love !
singing together Islands in the stream That is what we are No one in-between How can we be wrong ?
Sail away with me Talk !
Just talk !
I am-- Shut up !

Okay , you heard something .
Um , yeah .
It &apos;s a booze cruise , but it &apos;s--there &apos;s more to the story than that .
A booze cruise ?
What do you mean ?
Leadership off-site .
Uh , booze cruise is just a rhyme .
And Michael , we discussed the IRS &apos;s regulations .
Yeah , I got--I don &apos;t even know why I said booze cruise .
This event has to have legitimate business content to be tax-deductible .
We discussed that .
( Michael ) Of--of course , of course , of course .
Yes , yes .
Look , I have a whole program planned .
Jan , this program is going to change people &apos;s lives .
I am going to be dropping serious knowledge all over the boat .
Good .
This is Brenda Matlowe from corporate training .
Hello .
I thought that she could attend tonight and if your event is appropriate , you could give it to other branches .
Oh , cool , cool .
And maybe you could attend tonight and then you could stay over at my house ... sighs ( Michael ) For the night .
Awkward .
That &apos;s--you know what , Brenda ?
Could Jan and I have a moment alone ?

Just--we &apos;re not going to pay for a bathing suit .
Okay .
I know what you &apos;re all thinking .
Who is this smart , little cookie ?
Her name is Brenda ... something , and she is from corporate .
And she is here , like you , to learn from what I have to say .
I am a great motivational speaker .
I attended a Tony Robbins event by the airport last year , and ... it wasn &apos;t the actual course .
You have to pay for the actual course .
But , it talkedabout the actual course .
And I &apos;ve incorporated a lot of his ideas into my own course .
Leader ... ship .
The word ship is hidden inside the word leadership as its derivation .
So , if this office is in fact a ship , as its leader ...
I am the captain .
But ... We &apos;re all in the same boat .
Teamwork .
Last year , Michael &apos;s theme was &quot; bowl over the competition . &quot;
So guess where we went ?
Now , on this ship that is the office , what is the sales department ?

- I enjoy having <unk> in bed .
I like <unk> up to the smell of bacon .

And since I don &apos;t have a <unk> , I have to do it myself .
So most nights , before I go to bed , I will lay six <unk> of bacon out on my George Foreman Grill .
Then I go to sleep .
When I wake up , I <unk> in the grill .
I go back to sleep again .
Then , I wake up to the smell of crackling bacon .
It is delicious .

It &apos;s the perfect way to start the day .
Today I got up , I stepped onto the grill , and it clamped down on my foot , that &apos;s it .
I don &apos;t see what &apos;s so hard to believe about that .
- I &apos;ve had a Foreman Grill for about six years .
I &apos;ve done about <unk> % of my <unk> on it , but I &apos;ve never <unk> myself .
Probably because I don &apos;t use it as a pillow .

What a <unk> .
He &apos;s-- you know what ?
I <unk> to myself that if I ever got to walk around the room as manager , people would laugh when they saw me coming and would <unk> as I walked away .
- I &apos;m serious , my closet doors will not shut .
I mean , it only takes so long to measure to make sure that clothes will hang up .
&apos;Cause aren &apos;t all <unk> , like , that big ?
So I don &apos;t understand why the closet <unk> didn &apos;t think of that .
So now , I &apos;m doing this new thing where I just leave piles of clothes on the floor .
And I walk around the piles to get an outfit .
- You know who used to sit at that desk ?
- That guy <unk> , who quit to form his own company ?
- Mm-mm .
Todd Packer .
- No , I thought he was out on the road .
He was , but , uh ... that desk was empty .
He &apos;d come in and sit there sometimes .
- Ah .
- When I was in training , many years ago , not so long ago , I worked side by side with a <unk> named Todd Packer .
And together , we <unk> the office .
clattering Packer and I once spent a whole day with our pants off .
And when people <unk> , we convinced them that they were crazy .
I would <unk> pay you Tuesday for a <unk> today .

- Oh , uh , just somewhere in the Poconos .
I was just <unk> .

You know what a great color is on me ?

It &apos;s like waves <unk> against the <unk> .
- <unk> , pink , the color , <unk> , the person , hot <unk> , <unk> anything that is awesome , snow <unk> - Hey , Jim .
Michael wanted me to ask you how to raise your desk chair .
- It &apos;s the <unk> on the side .
- That &apos;s what I told him .

- Oh , my God , he is so cute .
Would you talk to him for me and see if he likes me ?
- Oh , no , I don &apos;t think I can-- - Oh , please , Jim .

- What happened in Michael &apos;s office was wrong .
I understand it .
It makes sense .
laughs But it <unk> it was still wrong .
- Obviously , this was Kevin .
This is his sense of humor exactly .
- There are so many people with <unk> .
Even me .
Almost everyone is a <unk> .
chuckles <unk> did this is a <unk> .
laughs - I can &apos;t imagine anybody in the office hates Michael that much .
Well , maybe .
- I think this whole <unk> on Michael &apos;s carpet happened for a good reason .
Him sitting next to me is a huge gift .
This girl I know would say that it was a gift from God , but I don &apos;t know about all that .
Why would somebody ruin a <unk> good carpet ?
I don &apos;t know .
Could be done out of hate .
Could be done out of love .
It could be completely <unk> .
Maybe somebody hates the cleaning lady .
And , well , she doesn &apos;t do a very good job , obviously .
because my office still <unk> like you would not believe .
I hate her .
scoffs - You know what ?
I am beginning to think that what happened to my carpet was an act of <unk> against the office .
The only thing that makes any sense .
- Hello , am I the 107th caller ?
Hello , Rock 107 , am I the 107th caller ?

- Yeah , that &apos;s right .
We could do a <unk> weekend .
I wonder if I could , like , call in sick on Friday .
And then get a <unk> weekend .
laughs - It &apos;s so hard to fall asleep .
And I just hate it , cause I try to go to bed at , like , 9 : 30 every night .
- Are you kidding ?
- No .
- Hi , guys .
- We haven &apos;t finished getting things in order from your last visit .
- I &apos;m just walking around .
- Were you ?
- Well , yeah .
- It &apos;s just that we &apos;re really <unk> over here , Michael .
- Oh , and I &apos;m not ?

Dwight is an idiot .
I know .
No , he &apos;s a little ... little <unk> .
He &apos;s the <unk> &apos;s brother , so ... - That &apos;s not true .
- Uh-huh .

- Who do you think did it ?
- Are you kidding ?
I thought it was you .
- Really ?

A person did this .
A person who works in this office .
Maybe all of them .
You know what ?
Today is not a good day for a sales contest .
We <unk> &apos;re not doing this today .
- That doesn &apos;t seem fair .
- You want to talk about fair ?
Does anyone need to smell my old carpet ?
You explain to me how that was fair , and I &apos;ll explain to you how this is fair .
Plus I just--I think that <unk> today was sort of taking advantage .
- But you &apos;re the one who <unk> today .
- I am a victim of a hate crime .
Stanley knows what I &apos;m talking about .
- That &apos;s not what a hate crime is .
- Well , I hated it a lot , okay ?
I-- You know what ?
If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment , we &apos;d be done .
Very well .
Then you &apos;re all punished .
- What &apos;s our punishment ?
- You &apos;re all on a <unk> .
Just sit there quietly .
phone ringing No , no .
phone ringing - Hey .
- What &apos;s up ?
- Nothing much .
Let me ask you something .
It &apos;s actually a little awkward .
- What ?
- What do you think of Kelly ?
- I don &apos;t know .
<unk> if you like a little <unk> in ... um , she &apos;s really cool .
- Are you interested in her ?
- Yeah , totally .
- Really ?
- Did she say something ?
- She said lots of things .
- Do you know if she &apos;s looking for a long-term thing or if she &apos;d be cool just hanging out ?
- I have no idea .
- Could you find out ?
- Yeah .
Sure .
- I don &apos;t know much about Kelly .
But why not ?
Try it out .
It &apos;s not like I &apos;m gonna be here that long .
And she &apos;s really cute .
Right ?
- Oh , long-term , definitely .
Fall in love , have babies , spend every second together .
But don &apos;t tell him that , okay ?
Just tell him I &apos;m , like , up for anything .
I mean , I &apos;m not a <unk> , but who knows ?
- Do you remember Ed Truck ?
- Sure , he hired me .
How &apos;s he doing ?
- How would I know ?
- I thought you might .
- My biggest fear is turning into him .
- Michael , you should have much bigger <unk> than that .
- sighs I wasn &apos;t talking literally , Creed .
Yeah , being <unk> alive would be worse .
Happy ?
Why am I talking to you ?
Ed ?
Hi , thanks for meeting me .
Must be kinda neat coming back .
- Yeah .
Shall we go upstairs ?
- Uh , well , <unk> , Ed , I really don &apos;t want to be up there right now .
- So what &apos;s the problem with my <unk> ?
- Oh , no , no , no .
You &apos;re good , it was <unk> .
You &apos;re good .
Um , what does that smell like to you ?
- I have a cold .
- For God &apos;s sake .
- What does that smell like to you ?
- Well , somebody did something in my office , and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was <unk> at me .
- But what was done ?
- I don &apos;t know .
I didn &apos;t get a good look at it .
But it smells horrible .
- Whoa .
sniffs - Yeah , yeah .
- Yeah .
- Yeah , somebody once did that in my office .
- Really ?
- Yeah .
- Well , that <unk> .
So how did you deal with people not liking you ?
- Well , some people liked me .
- Can I be <unk> ?
- You should say that before you speak frankly .
- You had no idea that people hated you so much ?
That <unk> me .
- I was their boss .
- Yeah , well-- - Now you &apos;re their boss .
You can &apos;t expect to be friends with everybody .
- Well , sure I can .
- No .
They &apos;ll always think of you as a boss first .
- Not necessarily .
You can love a boss like you do a father .
- I &apos;m not sure that ever happens .
- Well , okay .
Different management <unk> .
- Why can &apos;t your workers be your workers , family be your family , your friends be your friends ?
- Okay , yeah , sounds like a good idea .
- The best thing you can do for your workers is give them a strong , <unk> company to work at .
- Ah .
- That &apos;s what <unk> them with their real friends and their real family .
- Last week , I would &apos;ve given a kidney to anyone in this office .
I would &apos;ve <unk> right into my stomach and pulled it out for them .
But now , no .
I don &apos;t have the relationship with these people that I thought I did .
I hope they ask .
So they can hear me say , &quot; Uh , no .
&quot; I only give my <unk> to my real friends .
Go get yourself a monkey kidney . &quot;
- Hey , Brenda , this is , uh , Jim Halpert from the boat .
And I got your number from the corporate directory .
And , well , I was <unk> that you probably gave it to them because you wanted me to ask you out , right ?
Um , so give me a call back .
You can get my number from said directory , um , or just check your email cause I just sent you one .
Yikes .
Uh , give me a call back ...
I hope .
I &apos;ll talk to you later .
Bye .
- You just asked a girl out on the phone .
- Yup .
- Okay , look , I know what you &apos;re gonna say .

But you know what ?
It &apos;s <unk> and I really don &apos;t appreciate all the <unk> .
