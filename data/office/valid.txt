They &apos;ll be expecting some words .
First year , I spoke for nine minutes .
Second year , 11 minutes .
But you know , it doesn &apos;t matter how long you speak .
What matters is that you make it perfect .
So make it perfect .
( Dwight ) There was a time where I could &apos;ve won a trip to <unk> <unk> .
And I think you know what &apos;s there .
But in order to claim that prize , I would &apos;ve had to shout out in a room of over <unk> people .
I <unk> , I <unk> , and I paid the price .
Sometimes , the <unk> word in the world to say is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
What if I give a really long <unk> thank you ?
For instance , &quot; Thank you , Mr. <unk> .
&quot; Thank you very , <unk> That would look terrible .
These are mostly salesmen , and salesmen expect to be entertained .
And you are the main act .
When I was in the <unk> grade , I was a <unk> in our school <unk> bee .
It was me against <unk> <unk> .
And I misspelled , in front of the entire school , the word &quot; failure . &quot;
I can &apos;t do this .
That &apos;s because you &apos;re <unk> of doing it .
Because you don &apos;t know how .
Because you have no skills .
Dwight goes to Michael for <unk> talks .
To Michael .
Dwight , there &apos;s no way I can possible teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time .
Okay .
But I can teach you enough so that you don &apos;t embarrass me or the company .
Okay , deal .
I &apos;ll do whatever you say .
No questions asked .
Well , if you have a question , you should ask me .
I &apos;ll try and think of one .
Don &apos;t try to think of a question to humor me .
Just try not to be such an idiot .
Is that an <unk> or is that part of the public speaking advice ?
<unk> .
I &apos;m very <unk> , but I don &apos;t want the spotlight .
Michael should get the spotlight .
I should be the guy in the <unk> <unk> down the spotlight .
takes deep breath ( Pam ) Mom , I &apos;m sorry .
I know you and Dad are <unk> in for the wedding , but I do not want <unk> <unk> .
Yes .
Well , if you really want ... Hi , yeah , can I talk to one of your travel <unk> ?
I &apos;m gonna take a trip .
I &apos;m gonna get out of town for a while and go someplace ... not here .
chuckles Where do I wanna go ?
Um , that is an excellent question .
And one I probably should have thought about before I called you .
( Oscar ) I get here early every morning so I can set the <unk> .
I like it a little <unk> , around 66 degrees .
I &apos;m more productive .
Maybe some people don &apos;t like it as cold as I do .
But I don &apos;t care .
And what a lot of people don &apos;t understand about ... sales is that it has so much to do with organization .
I have a system in place for keeping track of who I speak to , when I speak to them , and what we have discussed .
<unk> cetera .
That &apos;s it ?
You &apos;re going to end with <unk> cetera ?
Okay , what &apos;s this big <unk> system that-- Well , do you think I should <unk> our <unk> system ?
No , that would be <unk> .
<unk> talk <unk> .
Not in a speech .
But the fact that you have no idea what to say , is , believe it or not , the least of our <unk> .
( Dwight ) It is ?
It &apos;s your delivery .
What is ?
Our biggest worry .
I don &apos;t follow .
My God , Dwight .
Best way to learn is by watching .
That &apos;s why <unk> is a <unk> dollar industry .
Let <unk> .
Sit down , let me wow you .
clears throat screams Oh , God !
See ?
I have your attention now , don &apos;t I ?
You &apos;re scared , but now you &apos;re ready to learn .
Oh , no .
You do not want to go to India .
It &apos;s smelly and it &apos;s horrible and you can &apos;t even walk around by yourself without getting killed or worse .
That &apos;s what my dad says .
( Jim ) Oh , okay .
Pam !
Oh , my God !
Can we please start sending out the save the date announcements ?
&apos;Cause your wedding &apos;s on June 10th and that &apos;s right around the corner and I know this is weird , but I really need to know if I should save the date .
Um-- &apos; Cause if I had an announcement , then I could start <unk> up for a fancy dress .
But <unk> , I &apos;ll just get a pair of shoes .
No , boots .
<unk> <unk> in vending machine But seriously , what &apos;s the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman ?
<unk> has a vagina .
It &apos;s a joke , Dwight .
It &apos;s not a sex <unk> class .
But I &apos;m right .
Yeah , you &apos;re right about the difference between a man and a woman but not about the <unk> to the joke , all right ?
The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman is boobs .
Hey , do you remember the speeches that you gave ?
I do , both of them .
Could I have a copy of one of them ?
No , no , they would remember .
Look , it doesn &apos;t matter what you say , it just matters that you &apos;re saying something that people care about .
Yeah ?
All right , here we go .
Watch this .
Attention everybody !
Attention please .
I have some very great news from corporate .
We had a wonderful quarter , and as a <unk> , all of you are getting bonuses for $ 1,000 .
Yeah !
( Michael ) Congratulations .
applause and excited chatter You see that ?
You see how they <unk> to me ?
In that moment , I had them .
That is so great about the bonus !
No , no , it &apos;s not true .
I was just talking .
So just go out there and say anything .
They &apos;ll eat it up .
They &apos;re a great <unk> .
Go ahead , get the wallpaper .
<unk> the <unk> if you want .
( Dwight ) Excuse me .
May I have your attention please ?
There had been an accident on <unk> West .
<unk> have <unk> off the road into the safety <unk> .
Several cars have <unk> .
There is broken glass everywhere .
Several people are injured .
Do we know anyone who was in the accident ?
Brad Pitt .
Also , there will be no bonuses .
Why would this affect our bonuses ?
They &apos;re <unk> .
Is Brad okay ?
He will never act again .
Also , this branch is closing .
What the hell is going on here ?
Are we out of jobs ?
Yes .
This is <unk> because of what he did to <unk> <unk> .
He was kidding .
Dwight was kidding .
And I don &apos;t know why because it wasn &apos;t funny and it was just horrible .
Michael ?
Yeah ?
You said we were getting bonuses .
That was just a funny joke , remember ?
You <unk> .
So nobody &apos;s hurt ?
I don &apos;t know about that .
People are injured in car <unk> every <unk> seconds .
Shut it .
Come on .
Teri , cancel the wallpaper .
Michael sighs Well , that didn &apos;t go well .
No , it did not and that is because at no time did you employ the use of humor .
We &apos;ll find you a joke that not even you can ruin .
laughs All right .
Listen up , please .
Dwight has a joke .
softly Stop it .
Two <unk> walk into a bar .
Please don &apos;t tell a sailor joke .
Oh , why not ?
Her <unk> &apos;s in Iraq .
Iraq is <unk> .
<unk> are on water .
Yes , but they &apos;re both in danger .
Yeah , well , you know what ?
We need to-- all right , everybody in the conference room now .
Let &apos;s go .
Let &apos;s do it .
As your leader and your friend , I sort of <unk> that you can all speak in public as I can .
And did .
Twice .
You saw the plaque , right ?
( Michael ) All right , we &apos;re all gonna go around the room and we &apos;re going to make toasts .
And that way , we will <unk> our fear of public speaking .
You mean <unk> ?
Pam , I &apos;m public speaking .
Stop public interrupting me .
Okay ?
Who &apos;s gonna start ?
How about Phyllis ?
You kick us off and then we &apos;ll move around .
Go ahead .
What are we supposed to talk about ?
Anything your heart <unk> .
Um , I would like to toast to the good fortune I &apos;ve been having <unk> .
<unk> !
slightly louder I met a man and I &apos;m totally in love .
And that &apos;s a <unk> of my life that I thought I &apos;d closed .
Uh , I was <unk> depressed for the longest time and , um , I have to admit , I had some very dark thoughts .
Good , good , good , good .
That &apos;s good .
Now see , that &apos;s not so hard , right ?
All right , who &apos;s next ?
Who are we going to <unk> !
Ryan .
Ryan &apos;s next .
Why am I next ?
I thought we &apos;d go in order .
Don &apos;t be shy , shy boy .
Don &apos;t be shy .
Get up there .
Well , a lot of you know that I &apos;m in business school and while I &apos;m learning a lot here , a lot , hopefully soon , I &apos;ll land a challenging , <unk> or <unk> position somewhere else .
cheers and applause Stop , stop , stop , stop !
That &apos;s--you know what ?
The toasts are really not supposed to be about anything .
And certainly not supposed to be about going anywhere or doing anything else .
So .
Ryan is a temp and that means that he could go at any time .
Am I worried about that ?
Try scared to death .
Who &apos;s next ?
Pammy .
Oh .
That &apos;s okay .
Actually , this would be good practice for your wedding toast .
Yeah , the <unk> doesn &apos;t really do-- Have you ever been to a wedding ?
( Jim ) Can I go ?
Yes , good .
Jim taking the <unk> .
So , uh , I am going on a trip .
But I &apos;m not really sure where I &apos;m going yet .
It &apos;s kinda <unk> .
So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions .
It &apos;s not off to a good start , but we &apos;ll see where this goes .
I really like Florida .
( Jim ) Oh , really ?
Like <unk> or ?
More of the <unk> area .
I &apos;ve been to <unk> a <unk> times .
It &apos;s like a trip around the world .
Oh , well , I was actually thinking of taking a trip around the actual world .
Then you should look into the <unk> cruise .
Okay .
You should go to <unk> .
What is that ?
It &apos;s like Club <unk> , but everything is naked .
I was thinking more like <unk> .
Or something like that , but good second choice .
Been to Amsterdam .
Oh , okay , you know what ?
That &apos;s not a toast .
You &apos;re not standing up .
To Amsterdam .
When did you go there ?
Um , after my divorce .
( Jim ) Really ?
For like how long ?
About a week or ... Maybe a month .
I don &apos;t-- <unk> , listen to me .
You do not want to go to Amsterdam , trust me .
Where do I wanna go ?

You could hang there .
And I might still have some friends .
Really ?
Really , Creed ?
I was a action movie star in China in the &apos; <unk> after my band broke up .
And , um , I played a lot of police <unk> .
chuckles Sometimes a <unk> .
I &apos;m , uh ... kind of a movie star there .
I &apos;d like to say hi to my friends in China .

Maybe we should move on to somebody else .
Okay .

Actually , yes .
