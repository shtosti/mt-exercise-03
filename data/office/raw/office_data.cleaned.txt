Tonight is the Dundies,


the annual employee awards night
here at Dunder Mifflin.


And this is everybody's
favorite day.


Everybody looks forward to it.


Because, you know,
a lot of the people here


don't get trophies
very often.


Like Meredith or Kevin.


I mean, who's gonna give
Kevin an award,


Dunkin' Donuts?


Plus, bonus,
it's really, really funny.


So I--You know, an employee
will go home,


and he'll tell his neighbor,
"Hey, did you get an award?"


And the neighbor'll say,
"No, man."


I mean, I slave all day.
Nobody notices me.


Next thing you know,


employee
smells something terrible


coming from
the neighbor's house.


Neighbor's hanged himself.


Due to lack of recognition.


So...


Wow.


Those are, um...gleaming.


You buy a new pair
every day, or...


I like keeping them
new-looking.


Jim chuckles


So you ready for...
the Dundies?


Ugh.


(Pam)
You know what they say
about a car wreck,


where it's so awful,
you can't look away?


The Dundies are like
a car wreck that


you wanna look away
but you have to stare at it


because your boss
is making you.


Hey-hey-hey!


It's Fat Halpert!


What?


Fat Halpert!


Jim Halpert.


So why don't I take
you on a tour


of past Dundie winners?


We got Fat Jim Halpert here.


Jim, why don't you show off
your Dundies to the camera?


Oh, I can't
because I keep them hidden.


I don't wanna look at them
and get cocky.


Oh!
That's a good idea.


(Dwight)
And mine are at home,


in a display case
above my bed.


Yeeaacck! TMI.
TMI, my friends.


(Michael)
TMI?


Too Much Information.


Uh, it's just easier
to say TMI.


I used to say "Don't go there,"
but that's lame.


And here we have
Stanley the Manley.


Now, Stanley
is a Dundie all-star.


Aren't you, Stanley?


Why don't you, uh,
show them some of your bling.


I don't know where they are.


I think I threw
them out.


Oh, no, you di-in't.


Uh, think I did.


Mm--Why did--


Say, we gotta order some more
appe-teasers this time


We ran out last year,
remember?


Yes, we should.
I--You know what?


I wanted one of those
skillets of cheese.


But when I got off stage,


someone had eaten
all of them.


I am psyched for the Dundies.


I got a sitter for my kid.


I am gonna drink frozen drinks


paid for by Dunder Mifflin.


I'm gonna eat some good
Chili's food


and hopefully...
meet someone nice at the bar.


I love the Dundies.
The only thing


I don't like about the Dundies


is that Michael thinks I have
the gene for alcoholism,


and so he cuts me off
after like two drinks.


I usually share a table
with Phyllis.


inhales, exhales


Well...


I haven't eaten anything
all day.


And I think I'm gonna
skip lunch


so that I can maximize
my food at the Dundies.


I think I'm gonna share some
Cadillac Fajitas with Toby.


Toby is so cute...except
he has that stupid kid.


There's a lot of drinking
at the Dundies,


and people say
very inappropriate things.


I never should have had
that drink last year.


One year, I didn't go,


and then what happens is


Michael tells you about it
over and over again.


Like for a month.


So it's--
it's less painful to go


and just get it over with...


than...than not go.


You think you're getting
away with it.


Well, you're not.


Yes, I'm the designated driver,
which is very important.


We need everyone
to get home safely.


But no one ever gives me
gas money,


and people live all over.


It's expensive.


inaudible conversation


Pfff.


Like a gaggle of geese.


high voice
Mee-mee-mee-mee.


giggling
It was you.


It wasn't.
I swear.


Yeah, it was.


So what's the joke?


You're not perfect either.


We're not laughing
at you, Dwight.


So who are we
laughing at?


Um, just something
somebody wrote.


Who? Dave Barry?


No, no.


Just something that was written
on the ladies room wall.


What is it?
Who wrote it?


Um, it's kind of private.


whispering
It's about Michael.


giggling


That is defacement
of company property.


So you'd better tell me.


Kelly, if you tell me,
you'll be punished less.


Okay, now I'm laughing
at you.


giggling


It hasn't always been easy
being a whistleblower.


When I was in school,
the kids would call me


a tattletale
or a snitch or a worm.


So I really identify
with those women from Enron.


I wrote them letters to tell
them how much they inspired me,


but they never wrote back.


I guess they're all married.


All right,
we need something for Kevin.


(Jim) Mmm-hmmm.
What do we know about him?


He's an accountant.


He plays guitar,
he likes naval history.


He's a bowler.
He's fat.


The fat accountant award.


Well, you seem to
have this under control.


The weird part
about this whole deal


is that Michael truly believes


that these awards are
inspiring and motivational.


I mean, he puts more effort
and time and commitment


into the Dundies than anything
else he does all year.


Which is probably why
this branch will be downsized.


(Michael)
I am the fat accountant.
Michael, I need to talk to you.


Here he is.


I just thought
that you might like to know


that someone has written
something about you


on the ladies' room wall.
Really?


What did they say?


"For a good time,
call Michael Scott"?


Good one.
Uh, no, no.


No, I think
something bad, maybe.


Why do you think that?


You just immediately
go to that, Dwight?


Why are you so negative?
Why are you--


Michael.
I mean, you just come in,


and you're just negative...
Michael.


...and you just walk
negatively.


Do you want me to find out
what it says?


Yes.


By any means necessary?
What does that even mean?


What are you...what are
you talking about?


(Dwight)
It's the ladies' room.


Just go and find out what
it says and who said it


and report back to me.


But don't tell anybody that I
have anything to do with it,


because if they ask me, I
will say that you are crazy.


Thank you.
You won't regret this, Michael.


What award would you
like to give Dwight?


I hadn't planned on
including him.


Okay.


Kevin.


To Oscar Martinez,


it's the
Show Me the Money award.


Michael has taped
every Dundies Awards.


And now he's making me
look through


hours of footage
to find highlights.


For the ladies.
Hit it, Dwight.


playing flute


A little bit of Pam
all night long


A little bit of Angela
on the thing


(Pam)
Oh, yeah.


This is the part
where Kevin sat


in front of the camcorder
all night.


It's great.


A little bit of Roy
eating chicken crispers


A little bit of Tim
with some ribs


A little bit of Matt--


Angela, it's simple.


Just tell me what
the bathroom wall says.


I don't talk about
what goes on in the restroom.


I'm not asking
what you do in there.


I just want to know
what's written about Michael.


I don't say those kinds of
things out loud.


It's inappropriate.


Okay, I'll talk.


You nod if I get it right.


Does it have to do with
his butt or his wiener?


Angela sighs


Will her highness
Jan Levinson-Gould


be descending from her corporate
throne this evening


to visit us lowly serfs
here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?


It's a two-and-a-half-hour
drive from New York, Michael.


Well, you could take the bus.


You could work
on the way here,


sleep on the way home.
No.


Come on, Jan.
This is important.


I mean, this is,
this is validation


to my employees here


that you and corporate
approve of this.


Well, we don't
approve of this, Michael.


W--
I mean, you only have
the budget


for one office party
a year, so...


we're not paying for this.


Um--


Can you--?


Are you there, Michael?
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.


I just wanted to, uh...


talk to you for
a second about that.


Um, what, uh, what is--


I mean, come on!
Jan.


What's--You're droppin'
an A-bomb on me here.


Really? I'm dropping
an atomic bomb on you?


Well, yeah.
I mean, what is--


Right.


You already had a party
on May 5th for no reason.


No reason!
It was the 05-05-05 party.


It happens once
every billion years.


And you had a luau.


And the tsunami relief
fundraiser,


which somehow
lost a lot of money.


Okay, no, that was
a funraiser.


I think I made that
very clear in the flyers.


Okay, well, I don't
understand why anyone...


Fun. F-U-N.
...would have a tsunami
fun raiser, Michael.


Well, I think
a lot of people


were very affected
by the footage.


All right, just watch
the off-color jokes.


I got a lotta complaints
from H.R. last year.


Ugh, well, that's Toby.


Jerk-face. He, uh...


hasn't won a Dundie,
and it's sour grapes,


and he's a very bitter,
bitter...


Jan sighs
...young balding man.


All right.
I gotta go, Michael.


What? Okay.
We'll talk about this later.


No, this all sounds great.
This sounds great.


Jan, indistinct
So maybe we'll see you later.


Okay. All right, buh-bye.


Oh, let's see.
What's on the computer?


Uh, yes, that's true.
I have never won a Dundie.


I am more than okay with that.


It's a little character
I like to do.


It is, uh,
loosely based on Carnac,


one of Carson's
classic characters.


Here we go.


The PLO, the IRA,


and the hot dog stand
behind the warehouse.


rips envelope


Name three businesses that have
better healthcare plans


than Dunder Mifflin.


Here's the problem.


There's no open bar
because of Jan.


And it's the reason why


comedy clubs have
a two-drink minimum.


I mean, it'll be fine,
I just...


wish people were gonna be drunk.


I think his characters
are pretty funny.


Especially Ping.


Well, what should I do, guys?


Seriously, do you want me to
just cancel the Dundies?


No, we were just hoping you
wouldn't do those characters


like last time.
Ping?


Everybody loves Ping.
He's my most popular character.


I think many people find
that character slightly racist.


Really?
Well, he is based on


the Chinese delivery
guy that I have


who talks exactly like that,


so I think you should take it
up with him instead of me.


Well, I'm just saying
there are many people


that are offended
by your insensitive skits.


sighs Well, neither of you
are Chinese, so what...


Why do you care?


(Phyllis)
Dwight, get out of here.


What are you doing
in the ladies room?
It's not what you--


No! Why were you in there?


You are a pervert!
What were you doing in there?


I am not.
I'm telling Michael.


I am on official business.
Michael!


Phyllis, you are not.
Michael!


No--stop it!


Stop it!
Michael.


Michael--no, do not listen
to her.


Dwight was in the ladies room,


and he was looking at me.
What?


This is not true.
He was looking at me


in the ladies' room.
That is totally unfair!


I was just in the ladies'
room in order to spy.


Dwight, Dwight, that--you've
hit an new low, my friend.


That's what I said! He was
spying in the ladies' room.


What do you think, Phyllis?


You think I followed
you in there like, "Oh good.


Phyllis is going
to the bathroom,


so maybe I get to see
her naked from the waist down."


I'm not even attracted to you.


That is a good point.


Write him up,
or I'll take it to Jan.


Okay, all right,
I will do that.


I will get to that definitely.


Absolutely.


When?
Oh, I don't know.


Maybe after I finish writing,
producing, directing,


and hosting your awards show,
all right?


Just relax,
keep your pants on.


Unless, of course,
you're in the bathroom


and you should be able to take
your pants off in that case


without Creepsville Central
spying on you.


Good.


The Dundie award
for longest engagement


goes to Pam Beesley.


Pam, everybody!
Yoo!


When is that girl
gonna get married?


That's what I have to say.
Aha, Roy's accepting.


Thank you, Roy, are there
any words you'd like to say


on Pam's behalf?


(Roy)
Uh, we'll see you next year.


(Michael)
Yeah! Oh, hope not!
Hope not.


I'm not changing that.
That's the best one.


No, it's hilarious.
You're right.


I just think, um,
World's Longest Engagement,


um, we're all expecting it,
you know?


That's why it's funny.


Every year that Roy and Pam
don't get married


it gets funnier.


Well, I think if you use
the same jokes,


it just comes across as lazy.


Oh. Lazy.


Uh-huh.


Excuse me, everyone.


Can I have your attention,
please?


I just wanted to say


that the women in this office
are terrible.


Especially the ones


who wrote that stuff
about Michael


on the bathroom wall.


Having a bathroom
is a privilege.


It is called a ladies' room
for a reason.


And if you cannot behave
like ladies,


well, then, you are not
going to have a bathroom.


You're taking away
our bathroom?


We are going to have
two men's rooms.


But where would we--go?


Be prepared to hold it, folks.
Okay, okay.


From 9:00 a.m.--
Look.


(Pam)
Michael...
Yes?


Dwight's banning us
from our bathroom.


Okay, well, that's ridiculous.
So just don't--


I don't have time
for this right now.


There needs to be repercussions
for people's behavior.


Stop it! Stop it!
Okay.


Look, I know there have been
a lot of rumors flying around


about the Dundies this year,


how there is no money
and how there is no food,


and how the jokes
are really bad.


But, what the hell, everybody?
I mean--


God, the Dundies are about
the best in every one of us.


Can't you see that?
I mean--


Okay, we can do better.


(Michael)
So tonight,
for the first time,


we are inviting all of your
friends and family


to attend the awards
with us.


Yes.


(Michael)
Yeah, not bad, right?


So let's make this
the best Dundies ever.


claps hands
Best Dundies ever.


All right, let's wrap it up.
Come on, we're late.


The Dundies
are starting very soon.


Accounting, let's go, let's go.


Okay, I gave you fair warning.


Out. Who's next,
customer service?


Meredith, let's roll.

I'm glad that

You never have to work

You're just a name a number
and no one even says hello


Card!
Come on.


The Dundies are kind of like
a kid's birthday party.


And you go, and there's really
nothing for you to do there.


But the kid's having
a really good time.


So you're kind of there.


That's--that's kind
of what it's like.

Yeah, you know me


You down with the Dundies

So we are here.


Thank you all for coming
to the 2005 Dundie awards.


I am your host,
Michael Scott.


So, Pam, I wonder
who's gonna get


"longest engagement"
this year.


Well, you're not gonna get
longest engagement, man,


'cause we got that
locked up.


I wonder what I'll get.


I brought my fiancée.


And I just wanna tell you,
please, please,


do not drink and drive.


Because you may hit a bump
and spill the drink.


I'll just put these
on the group tab.


Nope, actually,
this year, no group tab.


We're gonna be doing
separate checks.


What?
Oh, great.


You said we could bring
our families.


I did, and why didn't you,
Stanley?


I did. My wife's
name is Teri.


Well, I'm looking forward
to meeting Teri.


It's this person whose hand
I'm holding, Michael.


recorded deep voice
Oh, yeah.


whispers to Dwight
Shut it.


Um, good.


Speaking of relationships
of all--


all waves, shapes,
and forms,


um, I was out


on a very, very hot date
last night


with a girl
from H.R., Dwight.


Really? We don't have
any girls from H.R.


No, uh...


F-for the sake
of the story.


And things were getting
hot and heavy.


(Dwight)
Yeah?


And I was about to take
her bra off,


when she had me fill out
six hours' worth of paperwork.


Like an AIDS test?


No.


God.


(Michael)
Ahem!


All right, so let's get
this pahty stahted!


Hey, let's go
to Poor Richard's.


Yeah,
let's get out of here.


Um...


Guys, where are you going?


Pam,
show's just getting started.


Sorry.


clears throat loudly


And now to celebrate...


You staying?
Yeah.


Gotta eat somewhere.


The Busiest Beaver Award
goes to Phyllis Lapin!


Yeah!


Way to go, Phyllis.
Nice work. Per usual.


This says Bushiest Beaver.
What?


I told them busiest--
Idiots.
It's fine.


We can fix it.
We'll fix it up.


You don't have
to display that.


All right, our next award...


ah, yes, this award goes to


the most creative writing
on the ladies' room wall,


and the winner is...


Who is it?


Who wants to claim it?
Shiny Dundie.


Who wrote it?


Great idea, Dwight.


Because that's what happens
every time!
He's a jackass!


Every year.


Come on, we're going
to Poor Richard's.


No, I don't wanna go.
I don't want to!


Pam, no.
If you would've asked me that,
then you would know.

Herro, everybody!


Hey...how are you?
I thought you left.


Um, no, I just--
I decided to stay.


Oh.
I'll just get a ride
home from Angela.


(Michael as Ping)
I going to call
the next award!


Oh, good, I'm just
in time for Ping.


Oh, that would be where?


Uh, me so horny, right?
You know what I'm talking about.


Can I get a drink?
(Michael as Ping)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.


This next award goes to somebody
who really lights up the office.

Yeah, but why'd you

This is a bowler.
I know.


It's--they didn't have
any more businessmen.


Yeah, but I don't--
Just sit down, Kelly.

It's so freaking hot in there.

Um, thanks for listening,
those of you who listened.

This last Dundie is for Kevin.


This is the Don't Go In There
After Me award.


It's for the time that I went
into the bathroom after him,


and it was really,
really smelly.


There you go.


Yay, Kevin!


Whoo hoo!
For Kevin!


For stinking up
the bathroom!


Yeah, all right, Kev!
Whoo!


Hey, I haven't gotten one yet.


(Jim)
Yes, I have not

All right,
we'll keep it rolling.


Okay, this is
the Fine Work Award.


This goes to Stanley

he did this year.


You know you did.


(Pam)
Hear, hear.


Speech, speech, speech,
speech, speech, speech...


Well, last year,
I got Great Work.

So I don't know what
to think about this award.


But, at least I didn't get


Smelliest Bowel
Movement like Kevin.


giggles


light cheers and applause


And this next award is going out
to our own little Pam Beesley.


I think we all know
what award


Pam is gonna be
getting this year.


It is
the Whitest Sneakers Award


because she always has
the whitest tennis shoes on!


Get on down here!


Pam Beesley,
ladies and gentlemen.


Ooh, here we go.


I have so many people to thank
for this award.


laughs


Okay, first off, my Keds,


because I couldn't have
done it without them.


Thank you.


Let's give Michael
a round of applause


for emceeing tonight,


because this is a lot harder
than it looks.


And also because
of Dwight too.


Um, so, finally,


I wanna thank God
because God gave me this Dundie.


And I feel God
in this Chili's tonight.


Whoo!


Pammy B.,
ladies and gentlemen.


Oh, thank you.


Yeah!
Chair?


Oh!


sighs
sighs


(Jim)
What a great year
for the Dundies.


We got to see Ping.


And we learned Michael's
true feelings for Ryan.


Which was touching.


And we heard Michael
change the lyrics


to a number
of classic songs.


Which for me,
has ruined them for life.


Michael singing
I've Had the Time of My Life


What?


Nothing.


Okay.


What?
I don't know, what?


Oh, my God.


You are so drunk.


Did you get that?
Pam laughs


Please tell me that you got--


Vince, Vince!
Woman has had a seizure!


(Dwight)
Grab her tongue!
Grab her tongue!


It's okay,
I'm a sheriff's deputy.


Well, he's a volunteer.
Don't get into that now.


We need something
to cushion her head.


A throw pillow?
A cushion?


Okay, I'm gonna use my shirt.


Dwight, this is crazy.
Okay.


Jim, not now!


We need to cushion
her head.


Lie still. Please, Pam.


Do not move.
Dwight, Dwight.


I'm sorry.
laughing I am fine.


Jim, don't interfere.


You have to put your clothes
back on.


People are trying to eat.


Can you
give me a second, sir?


No!
Dwight, let me up.


Right now.


I am a Sheriff's Deputy.
That's fine.


I could have my men
in here in a second


and have you arrested.


Pam, are you all right?


I'm fine.
Sir, sir.


How many fingers
am I holding up?


You're holding up
three fingers.


Are you okay?
Put your clothes on, right now.


I will. I will.
You need to calm down.


Was this year's
Dundies a success?


Well, let me see.


I made Pam laugh so hard that
she fell out of her chair.


And she almost
broke her neck.


So I killed.
Almost.


laughs


Oh, my God!


I just wanna say,


that this was the best
Dundies ever!


Whoo!


Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful, careful.


Don't wanna forget that.


You and your party
really need to leave right now.


Absolutely. Is this mine
or is this Chili's?


I--
You know what?
Don't worry about it.


Keep it. My gift.
Thank you.


Have a good night.
See you next year.


That's...fine.


We have a strict policy here
not to over-serve.


(waiter)
Apparently this young woman
was sneaking drinks


off other people's tables.


I Xeroxed her
driver's license,


and she is not welcome


at this restaurant
chain ever again.


clicks tongue


Great work tonight.
Watch your step.


Excellent.
Thanks.


I had to, uh,
check her pupils


to make sure
that wasn't a concussion.


Yes, that too,
but I mean with the audio.


Great, great work.


I feel bad about what I wrote
on the bathroom wall.


No, you don't.


laughs


Oh, here she is.


sighs
Careful, careful, whoa.


laughs
All right.
Easy.


Almost there.


Hey, um, can I ask
you a question?


Shoot.


Um...I just wanted
to say thanks.


That's not really
a question.


Okay, let's get
you home, pronto.


laughs


Elton John's Tiny Dancer


All right.
Bye.


Good night.
Have a good night.


Thank you, Angela.


(Elton John)
Hold me closer, Tiny Dancer


You had a busy day today


Hold me closer, Tiny Dancer


One sombrero--$20.


People leaving without paying


and sticking me with a bill
for $400...


$400.


Making someone laugh
until they puke...


Priceless.


My favorite Dundies moment?


I think it's when Angela
tied the cherry stem


with her mouth.


A couple of years ago,
I got an award


for tying a cherry stem
with my tongue.


I won't do that anymore.


She... she kinda went like...


It was pretty cool.


As for the bill, big deal.


People didn't pay, and I got
stuck with a tab for $400.


The joke is on them.


Do you realize how many
airline miles that is?


Six more years, and I will
see you in Mardi Gras.


upbeat music





Good morning, Pam.


(Pam)
Good morning, Michael.


What's going on?


Nothing.
You look nice today.


You look real thin.


Um...


Uh, I don't get
what you mean.


You just, um,
you look good.


Your shirt looks...
you look real good.


Uh...


Well, you said I look thin,
so what does--


That mean I'm, like,
thin weird,


or thin handsome, or...
laughs


Thin handsome, Michael.


Ah.
Yes, well, of course.


Of course.


I'm in a good mood.
My mom is coming in to visit.


She lives, like, two hours away


and she doesn't have
a cell phone.


Which is cool
'cause it's kind of adding


some suspense to my day,


and I keep looking
over at the door,


hoping she'll walk in.


clears throat


Hey, what's up?


Hey.


Any emails today?


Um, I don't think so.


No?


Um, check your spam folder.


Oh, there it is.


What?


Um...50 signs your priest
might be Michael Jackson.


Well done.
Topical.


I am king of forwards.


It's how I like
to do business.


Everybody joking around.


We're like Friends.


I am Chandler.


And Joey.


And, uh, Pam is Rachel.


And Dwight is Kramer.


laughing


Did you get it?


both laughing


both muttering, laughing


Got any emails?


Anything funny
happening in there?


Oh, yeah.
The one from corporate?


Yeah--what?
That's crazy, about Randall.


What?


"Informing you that
Randall Einhorn, our CFO,


has resigned due to
inappropriate conduct."


Wow.


That is out
of the blue.


"We hope that
this information


will put an end
to the rumors."


I did hear rumors...


Mm-hmm.


About him.


That is something.


So the monkey
does the sex thing right...


here!


both laugh


(Michael)
That's funny!


That's funny.


Not offensive.


Because it's nature,
educational.


Do want the link?


'Cause then you could
forward it around.


Um, I...


Consider it.


Maybe, maybe.


Well, we'll see.


Because I don't know
if it's a--


Wha--come on!


What has two thumbs
and likes to bone your mom?


This guy!


both laugh


Oh, you are so bad.


Yeah.


Oh, phew, ro, rah!
Aaah!


Oh, this guy
is out of control.


He is a madman.


Better get the bleep button
ready for him.


Bleep, bleep!


What's up, Halpert?
Still queer?


(Michael)
Uh-oh!


Oh ho ho!


Todd Packer and I
are total BFF.


Best friends forever.


He and I came up together
as salesmen.


One time we were out
and we met this set of twins.


And Packer told them
that we were brothers.


And so, you know,
one thing led to another.


And we brought 'em back
to the motel.


And then Packer
did both of them.


It was awesome.


It was...


I was about
to close this order,


and it was
a really big one.


That's what she said.


both laughing


Oh, man, did you get that?


"That's what she said."


Please don't involve me
in this.


Nice!
That is a classic.


Oh, oh, oh!
Oh.


Okay, grade-A gossip
for you right now.


Randall, CFO, resigned.


Nobody knows why.


Are you kidding?


Everyone knows why!


You don't know?
Oh, okay, check this out.


All right,
so here's the story.


So Randall is nailing
his secretary, right?


And she's totally
incompetent.


Really?
Here we go.


Buckle up, it's gonna be
a bumpy one.


We're talking "blonde
incompetent," right?


Oh, yeah.


Like, uh,
ten words a minute.


Talking.


Well, to be fair,
blondes, brunettes.


You know, there are a lot
of dumb people out there.


They are women, right?


Oh, wow!


I didn't say it!
I didn't say it!


I said it.


And then, suddenly,
for no reason,


this bimbo asks
for a pay raise, right?


Really?


Yeah, and Randall's like,
"Uh, I'm not giving a pay raise


to someone whose
bra size is twice her IQ."


Oh, wow!
Some people don't test well.


Okay, I'm telling
the story.


So anyway, this bimbo
blows the whistle


on the whole thing
just to be a bitch.


Oh, wow, what'd I tell you
about the bleep button?


Hey, what has two thumbs
and hates Todd Packer?


This guy!


So, uh, what are you, uh,
what are you around?


You doing sales calls
in the area?


What's going on?


I meant to ask you,
you think you can get someone


to drive me around because of
the DUI situation?


Oh, bad boy.


Um, Ryan.


makes quacking duck sound


Come on, kid,
let's go.


Oh, man.


That Todd Packer
can do anything.


Except pass
that breathalyzer.


(Todd)
They key is,
when you get pulled over,


you just stall 'em
for as long as you can,


or you just start crying,
you know?


You a big
William Hung fan?


Why does everybody
ask me that?


Who the hell is that?


Wait, Jim, no.


Don't drink directly
from the can, okay?


I'm serious.
It's all over the Internet.


They use the same shipping
company as a rat poison,


and it gets on the can.


Well, you're an idiot.


What can I say, Dwight?
I live a very dangerous life.


email chimes


monkey screeching


snickers


Did you get that?


Yeah, I got it.


You could see her--
It's fake.


How do you know?
She wouldn't do that.


She's a senator.


snickers
Oh, that's funny.


Ow!


Hey.


Hey.


Whoa, a little early
for your 4:00 candy, isn't it?


Yeah, I know.
I'm just, like,


a little bit,
you know...


Gotcha.


I'm really excited
to meet your mom.


You are?


Yeah.


I'm excited
to show her around.


She really wants
to meet everybody.


Oh, yeah?
Good.


'Cause I have
a lot of questions.


Oh, really?
Yeah.


As a child did Pam
show any traits


that would hint towards
her future career


as a receptionist?


Oh, yes.


When Pam was
a little girl,


she used to answer
the phone


and press
the hold button


for hours,
every day.


That's incredible.


She was just
a natural.


laughs


Hey, send me that link
to the monkey sex video.


I'm going to forward it
like it's hot.


Yes!


Forward it like it's hot


Forward it like it's hot


Old school.


Michael?


Yes, Toby.


Um, I need to talk to you
in your office.


It'll just take two seconds.


clears throat


Um, literally two seconds?


Toby is in HR,


which technically means
he works for corporate.


So he's really not
a part of our family.


Also, he's divorced,


so he's really not
a part of his family.


The full story
is that Randall resigned


because of
sexual harassment.


So corporate asked me
to do a five minute review


of the company's
sexual harassment policy.


No, no, Toby.
No.


It's really not
a big deal, Michael.


It is a big deal.


It's a big deal!


What are we supposed to do,


scrutinize every little thing
we say and do all day?


I mean, come on.


And then corporate
is gonna send in a lawyer.


What?
No!


Just to refresh you
on our policy.


What?
N-he--no.


Okay, what is a lawyer
gonna come in and tell us?


To not send out


hilarious emails
or not tell jokes?


Maybe not some of them.


Maybe not
inappropriate ones.


There is no such thing
as an appropriate joke.


That's why it's a joke.


Everyone?
Hello?


Everyone.
Hi.


Uh, sorry to interrupt.


I know you're all busy
and the last thing you want


is for a major
interruption.


But Toby has an announcement
that he insists on making


right now
in the middle of the day.


So take it away.


Yeah, okay.


Corporate would like us
to do a five minute review


of the company's
sexual harassment policy,


so I'll go over that later.


(Michael)
I wish you luck, Toby,
I really do.


But you are going to have
a mutiny on your hands.


And I just can't wait to see
how you handle it.


A guy goes
to a five dollar...


lady of the night.


And he gets crabs.


So the next day,
he goes back to complain.


And the woman says,


"Hey, it was only
five dollars.


What did you expect,
lobster?"


laughs softly


This is what's at stake.


Hey.
Hey.


I know we're having that


harassment thing
this afternoon.


Yeah.


Some times when we IM,


I send you that
little winking face


with the lipstick.


Yeah?
Yeah.


I realized that
might be harassment.


Yes,
it is harassment.


And I'm gonna be suing
the winking face.


I've hired the angry face
as my lawyer,


and you should be
hearing from him very soon.


Okay.
Okay.


laughing


elevator bell


Time to bring out
the big guns.


I am heading down
to the warehouse,


where jokes are born.


Find a killer joke
that'll just blow


everybody away
at the seminar later.


And remind them what is great
about this place.


So...ah!
Here they are.


Guys, wondering
if I could, uh,


get your help for something?


I am looking
for a new joke to tell.


And it needs to be
just killer.


And it does not
need to be clean.


So what you got?


Like, a joke?
A knock, knock joke?


Um, yeah--no.


I mean, better.
Better than that.


The type of stuff you guys
tell all day.


Well, those are some
awful tight pants you have on.


Where did you get 'em,
like, Queers 'R' Us?


Boys 'R' Us.


Oh!
All right, all right.


Well, yeah,
but you know.


A joke but not necessarily
at my expense.


Man, we can see
all your business


coming around the corner,
okay?


You need to, you know,
hide that.


Good thing you don't have
a lot of business


to start with.


Ohhhh, okay.


That was still about me.


Hey, hey, hey.


So you don't have
the biggest package.


Don't feel bad.
I don't feel bad.


I think he feels bad.


No, I don't.


You look like
you feel bad.


Okay, well...


You know, not exactly
what I was looking for.


But thanks, guys.
Thank you!


You look good in those pants.


He get it
from his mama!


catcalling


So, remember,
intent is irrelevant.


And that's it.
Pam.


Um, I just wanted to say
that--just,


my mom's coming in today.


Mmmmilf.


Thanks, Kevin.


Usually the day we talk about
sexual harassment


is the day that everyone
harasses me as a joke.


She's coming in today,
and maybe just don't joke


around about that stuff
in front of her?


Great point.


Uh, in fact, uh,
basic rule of thumb.


Let's just act every day
like Pam's mom is coming in.


All right, that's it.


If anybody has any questions
about anything,


you know where I sit
in the back.


applause


Hi, is it over?


Uh, yes.


No.
I know, I know.


It's good.
It is not over.


It is not over
'til it's over.


Did he tell you everything?


Obviously he didn't,


because you all still look
relatively happy,


albeit bored.


Do you realize
what we're losing?


Seriously.


Email forwards.


Exactly.
Mwah.


Can we afford to lose


email forwards?
Do we want that?


I hate them.


You send me these
filthy emails.


And you say,
"Forward them to 10 people,


or you'll have bad luck."


Give me a break.


Um, Stanley how about
that hot picture


you have by your desk?


The centerfold in the
Catholic schoolgirl's outfit?


I mean, it is hot,
it is sexy,


and it turns him on.


And I will admit,
best part of my morning


is staring at it.


But what, are we just
gonna take it away?


That is my daughter.


She goes to Catholic
girls' school.


Great!
He can leave it up!


I'm taking it down right now.


Leave it up, Stanley.
Leave it up!


Fight the good fight!


Um, what about
office romance?


Good point.
Yes.


Office romance.


For example,
Pam and I are dating.


Do we have to
disclose that?


We're not dating.


No, but I'm saying
hypothetically


if we were dating.


We're not dating.
I'm engaged.


Well, Roy is dead,
and I ask you out.


I would say no.


You say yes,
and we go out.


I would drown myself.


And now Roy and Pam
are dead,


and we have your
stupid rules to blame, Toby!


Office relationships
are never a good idea,


so let's just try
to avoid 'em.


But if you already have one,


you should disclose it
to HR.


Um, all relationships?


Even a one-night stand?


Uh, full disclosure.


Dwight and his electric pencil
sharpener are dating.


Uh, no, we're not.
Well, you said you hooked up.


Damn it, Dwight.
Okay, question.


When does this policy
go into effect?


Immediately.


imitates buzzer
Wrong, no.


New policies go into effect
next business day.


(Toby)
Okay, Dwight.


(Michael)
I think the old honor system
was fine.


For example, I have never
slept with an employee.


And believe me,
I could have.


Yeah, Meredith.


No, no, Catherine.
Remember her?


Remember how hot she was?


She would have definitely
slept with me.


She wasn't that hot.


Yes, she was.
Damn it, Kevin!


I'm in an office relationship.


It's special.


Mmm, she's nice,
she's shy.


She's actually here
if you wanna meet her.


Hold on a second.


Oh, my God.
Put on a shirt!


Put--I told you
that you'd be on camera.


I'm sorry, she's European.


No, I told you
that you'd be on camera.


Stop.


There really isn't
a problem here.


You are trying
to outlaw jokes.


Is that why you're
bringing in an attorney?


Is that--
he's bringing in a lawyer.


(Toby)
You know, some of these jokes,


you can just tell on your
free time with your friends.


Here's what he doesn't
understand.


This is our free time.


These are our friends.


And I think we have a right
to make our own rules.


I saw the most hilarious
monkey sex video


on the Internet this morning
with Michael.


I don't want things like that
to change.


What if Pam was a lesbian?


What if she brought
her "partner" into work?


Would that be
crossing the line?


No.


What if they made out
in front of everybody?


Well, that would be--
At home?


And I told everybody
everything about it?


Okay, I'm lost.


Okay.


Well, then,
let's act it out.


Pam, you will be girl A.


And girl B will be...


Okay, we'll use the doll.


Pam?


Pam?


I wish Todd Packer was here,
'cause he would love this.


I wonder if anybody else
would like to join us.


Oop.
Coming out of my mouth.


Hey, um,
we have to watch Toby's video


that he's showing us


in order to brainwash us.


And I was wondering
if anybody'd like to join in?


Gonna be fun.


Got microwave pizza.


What do you say?
Jim?


No, thanks, I'm good.


That's what she said.
Pam?


Um, my mother's coming.


That's what she said--
clears throat


No, but--okay.


Well, suit yourself.


Hey, Toby.


Hey, Dwight.


You said that we could
come to you


if we had any questions.


Sure.


Where is the clitoris?


On a website it said
on the crest of the labia.


What does that mean?


What does the female vagina
look like?


Technically, I am
in human resources.


And Dwight was asking
about human anatomy.


Um, I'm just sad
the public school system


failed him so badly.


You know,
maybe when you get


really comfortable
with each other,


you can ask for that.


Good.


Good.
And--


I should get back to work.


Okay.


In today's fast-paced
business climate,


it can sometimes
be hard to know


when a comment or an action
crosses the line.


Let's take a look
at a couple of scenarios


and ask ourselves,


where is the line?


The natural redhead.


Hey, Marie.


Hey, Joe, Mike.


Hey, settle a bet.


Are you a natural redhead?


laughter


Nah, she ain't red.
No, none of them are, man.


What does that even--
how does that even bad,


asking if you're a redhead?


Oh my--hey, stop the video!


Wait, go--stop it right there.
Stop it right there.


That's that girl
from that thing.


I banged this girl
right here.


That's her?


Yes, this is the one.
You remember...


No, the party?
You banged her?


Right here.
You are a naughty girl.


Whoa, whoa, whoa.


Okay, hypocrite.


Okay, she is a hypocrite.


That is such a scam.
Okay.


Yes?


Yes, I did.


Okay.


Well, we can talk
about that later then.


Okay, you are never
gonna believe this.


The girl in the video


we're watching
that corporate gave us.


Darryl banged her!


And...


He's about 90% sure.


Don't ever let this
little bitch


drive you around town.


We got lost
for half an hour.


I don't have any DUIs,
so l can drive myself.


But thanks.


Where is Michael Snot?


Sniffing some dude's thong?


Probably.


So you are the lawyer,
Mr. O'Malley.


I know a lot
of lawyer jokes.


I love lawyer jokes.


Well, it's probably because
you don't get 'em.


When I said before
that I was king of forwards,


you gotta understand
that I don't


come up with this stuff.


I just forward it along.


You wouldn't arrest a guy
who's just delivering drugs


from one guy to another.


You seem a little bit
agitated, Michael.


What's the problem?


The problem is that...


I am the boss.


And apparently
I can't say anything.


Well, that's--that's true
in a way.


You can't say "anything."


Where's the line?


Where's the line, Jan?


Do you need to see
the video again, Michael?


No, I've seen the video.
He talked the whole time.


No, I didn't.


sighs
What?


Attention, everyone.
Hello?


Uh, yes, I just want you
to know that, uh,


this is not my decision.


But from here on out,
we can no longer be friends.


And when we talk about
things here,


we must only discuss
work associated things.


And you can consider this
my retirement from comedy.


And in the future, if I want
to say something funny,


or witty,
or do an impression,


I will no longer ever
do any of those things.


Does that include,
"That's what she said"?


Mm-hmm, yes.


Wow, that is really hard.


Do you really think
you can go all day long?


Well, you always left me
satisfied and smiling, so...


That's what she said!


Michael...


Michael!


Michael, please.


There he is!


Mwah!


(Packer)
Come on!


You would have done the same.


You just didn't
think of it first.


Mi-Michael, please.
I-I--really.


That's not
my sense of humor.


Okay.
Hello.


Jan, Mr. O'Malley,


this is my lawyer
James P. Albini.


I believe you may
recognize his face


from the billboards.


He specializes
in free speech issues.


And motorcycle head injuries,
worker's comp,


and diet pill lawsuits.


This guy does it all.


Excuse me,
I'm sorry.


Michael, Mr. O'Malley
is your lawyer.


What?


Mr. O'Malley
is our corporate lawyer.


We have him on retainer
to protect the company,


as well as upper level
management


such as yourself.


So I'm not in trouble?


I am so used to being
the bad boy.


I am so used
to fighting corporate


that I forget
that I am corporate.


Upper management.


They hooked me up
with an attorney.


To protect me.


You can't be too careful
about what you say.


Mo' money, mo' problems.


Okay, well, let's get you
out of here, James.


Um, I think
we're under an hour still.


Yeah, but I did a lot
of paperwork at home.


We'll talk about it later.


Thanks for coming in.


Is William Hung here?


Um, hello.


Oh, my God!


I finally made it.


Hello!


I love my mom.


Okay, that's probably the
most obvious statement ever.


Okay,
so when do I get to


actually meet
all these people?


Um...


Bear says to the rabbit,
"Hey, it stick to your fur?"


He goes, "No."
He says, "Good."


Why don't we just, like,
stay here for a while,


and I'll show you
my desk.


Okay.
This is all yours?


Yeah, I am in charge
of this whole area.


Oh, my goodness.
That's great.


I think we are done with her
for a while.


Um, this is my picture of us
at Aunt Millie's barbeque.


The one that you, um...


Remember the one you said
I should get blown up?


So a guy goes home,
tells his wife,


"Honey, pack your bags,
I just won the lottery."


She goes, "Oh, my God.
That's incredible.


Where are we going?"


He goes, "I don't know
where you're going,


just be out of here by five."


laughter


Boom!


Why does he call her honey
if he hates her so much?


Doesn't she get half of his
money because they're married?


It's a joke, lurch.


This is where
I used to keep my computer.


Oh, right, I remember.


With the picture, yeah.


But I switched stuff around
because I actually needed,


like, more room
for organization.


This is, like, um...


Oh, there he is.


How are you?
Hey, handsome.


You look great.
Oh, thank you.


So, we ready for dinner?


Well, you know,
actually I kind of need to


stall a bit.


But it's okay,


because I am very used
to killing time.


Oh, I don't believe that.


Okay, I'm gonna go wait
in the parking lot.


And what kind of tunes
do you want for the ride?


A little classical,
a little oldies?


Oh, anything is fine.


All right,
well, see ya.


(whispered)
So which one is Jim?


(whispered)
Mom!


I just wanted to know.


No, it's...
All right, okay.


minutes,
then we can go to dinner.


I'll make myself busy.


There's this guy,


he's at a nymphomaniac
convention.


And he is psyched,


'cause all these woman
are smoking hot perfect 10s,


except for this one chick
who looks a lot like...


Phyllis?
Yeah.


No, no, no.
That crosses the line.


Ex-squeeze me?


Not you.


Kevin.
Just unwarranted.


Hostile work environment,
Kevin.


Packer said it.


No, you said it.


He pointed.
A point is not a say.


Look, Kevin,
we are a family here.


And Phyllis is a valued
member of that family.


Like a grandmother.


I'm the same age
as you, Michael.


I don't know about that.


We're the same
high school class.


Well, I have a late birthday


and usually September
is a cutoff point...


You know what?


You just crossed the line,
okay?


There is a line
and you went over it.


And you must be punished.
So go to your corner.


You mean
where my desk is?


Yes, your corner.
Go.


Okay.


I have a lot of work
to do, anyway.


(Packer)
Oh, my.


They really got to you,
didn't they?


They didn't get to me.


I got to them.


I am still
the same old Michael Scott.


New and improved.


You know what?


I love Phyllis.


You know what else?


I think she is gorgeous.


I think she is an incredibly,
incredibly attractive person.


Come here.
Give me a kiss.


Come on.


Michael, come on,
you don't have to worry.


I'm not gonna...
I'm not worried.


report you to HR.
You know what?


The only thing
I am worried about


is getting a boner.


Good work today,
everybody.


Times have changed
a little.


inhales deeply


And even though
we're still a family here


at Dunder Mifflin,
families grow.


And at some point,


the daddy can't take a bath
with the kids anymore.


I am upper management.


And it would be inappropriate
for me


to take a bath
with Pam.


As much as I
might want to.


He said what?


Toby actually gets alimony
from his ex-wife


because she makes more.


So that's kind of embarrassing.


Not that I'd mind,
but it would never happen to me


because I would make
the marriage work.


People seem to like him


because I think he's one of us,
but he's not.


He's this weird loner
who just tells people,


"Don't do this, don't do that.


Hire this person
for this reason."


mouths words


I would complain about him,


but who would I go to
to complain about Toby?


Toby.
Bias.


And what does he do about that?
Nothing.


Because he's Toby.


What kind of name is that?


It's almost a girl's name.


I think I've known more girls
named Toby than guys.


He just kind of makes my skin
crawl a little bit.


Toby is the devil.


Toby's the devil.


So I'm not a big Toby fan.


(Michael)
I'm an early bird,


and I'm a night owl.


So I'm wise
and I have worms.


Now.
knocking on door


Oh! Breakfast.


I got you your sausage,
egg, and cheese biscuit.


Yummy, yummy.
Thank you, Ryan.


What was the thing you
needed me to come in early for?


Um...


the sausage, egg,
and cheese biscuit.


But thank you,
and why don't you just...


Take a couple of hours.


Office is yours.


Home Alone,
Risky Business.


Take your pants off,
run around.


Whatever you wanna do.


I'm just gonna take a nap
in my car till work starts.


Okay.


See? Healthier.


Gotta watch those carbs.


Hey.


(Jim)
Oh, Pam, can I see you
in here for a second?


It's important, so...


Okay.


What?


What is this?


I found Dwight's wallet
in the parking lot.


Oh, my God,
what are we gonna do?


I don't know, I don't know.


I don't know
what the best play is.


Do we tear everything up,


or do we buy a horse
on the internet?


I mean,
I don't know what to do.


What do you think?


I know.
I know what to do.


Okay, what?


Okay, put everything back
exactly how you found it.


Okay.


Hey, Dwight, Jim and I found
your wallet in the parking lot.


What did you do to it?


Nothing.


I'm serious.
What did you do to it?


Dwight, I swear,
we didn't do anything.


Nice try.


Cancel card.


Cancel...card.


Cancel card.

Today I, Michael Scott,
am becoming a homeowner.


Investing in real estate.


Diversifying.
Smart.


Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.


It is very important
to own property.


Back in olden days,


they would not even
let you vote


unless you owned property.


They'd throw you in the stocks
and humiliate you.


And it worked.
Yes.


We should bring
the stocks back.


People will obey the law.


There'd be less troublemakers.


Maybe.
laughs


So what are the specs?
What?


What are the specs?
Oh, okay, I'll tell you.


Let's see here.


Three bedroom, two bath
contemporary townhouse...


Nice.


Two-car parking...
Yes.


Wall-to-wall carpet...
God, what a steal!


All fixtures included.


Yes, this is looking good.


Does it have a deck?


I think it does.


Have you seen it?
Yes.


Does it have a deck?


I think it has a--yeah,
it has a deck.


They call it a porch,
but it is a deck.


When a man is laying
on his deathbed,


there are four things that go
through his mind.


Was I well-loved?
Check.


Did I express myself?


Did I let my light shine
through?


Check.


Will an attractive woman cry
at my funeral?


Check--probably more than one.
Check, check, check, check.


Lastly, did I achieve success
and own real estate?


And when I close on this condo,


I will be able
to check that one as well.


sighs


(Pam)
Every so often,
Jim dies of boredom.


I think today it was
the expense reports


that did him in.


And, uh, our deal is


that it's up to me
to revive him.


You see Dwight's coffee mug?
Mm-hmm.


Sometimes when he's not here,


I try to throw stuff in it.


No way.
laughs


Let's do this.


crumpling paper


Oh!


Here.
Try paper clips.


Oh, wait.
This message.


For Dwight.


Perfect.


Uh!
Oh!


I love it, I love it.
What do you call it?


Schrute ball.


How about Skeet Schruting?


Did you just come up
with that?


Mm-hmm.
That is good.


That's it.
That's what it is.


Thank you.


Oh, somebody went in.


That was a team effort, Pam.


Oh!


I mean,
you've got stuff here.


You rented "Mermaids."
You can't--it's a movie.


You can't deduct that.
You know that.


(Angela)
It's not an office expense.


Yes, thank you.


Next year you should file
your stuff in a basket.


Remember, last year
he slipped by with "Stripes."


He put--he rented "Stripes,"
he had it for a week,


and that got through,
so maybe he's thinking


he can do that from now on.


Please.


Maybe he can file his things
in a paper bag.


That's not helping, Angela.
That's not helping him.


Homeowner.


About to join
an exclusive club, Dwight.


Maybe someday these people
out here will know


what that feels like.


Maybe not, who knows?
Not my problem.


You should go.


Yes. Yes.


Final walkthrough.
Mm-hmm.


Sign the papers
at the condo.


You have your lawyer there?


Uh, I don't need one.
Can I be your representative?


I don't need a representative.
I think I should be there.


No, no.
No, I'm good.


I can make sure
things are up to code.


No, Dwight. I'm fine.
Please?


I'm always the guy
that you rely on at work.


Well, this isn't about work.


This is closing on a condo.


It's completely personal.


So you're taking
a personal day?


clears throat


Except that


this is about
my living arrangement,


and as boss,


I need to have
a living arrangement


in order to do work.


Please?


I'll make you proud.


Okay, fine.
Yes, you can come.


Yes!
As your representative?


As my associate.


Same thing.
No, it is not.


Why don't you bring some work
that we can do in the car


and some Lunchables as snacks.


Lunchables are a whole lunch.


Just bring it.


I have been
Michael's number two guy


for about five years.


And we make a great team.


We're like one of those
classic, famous teams.


He's like Mozart,


and I'm like...Mozart's friend.


No.


I'm like Butch Cassidy,


and Michael is like Mozart.


You try and hurt Mozart,


you're gonna get
a bullet in your head


courtesy of Butch Cassidy.


in mocking Asian accent
Oh, most honorable Pamera.


Not offensive because that's
the way they talk in movies.


You headed out?
Uh, we are.


Dwight and I are going
to the big thing.


So why don't you have everybody


work on their expense reports,


and I'd like them in
by the end of the day.


Okay.
Very good.


Have a great time.
We will.


Um, did you do the thing


I asked you to do
about the magazines?


Yeah, I changed them
to your new address.


Good. The...


Small Businessman?
Yep.


Maxim?
American Way?


Cracked?


Yes.


I changed your Cracked
magazine subscription.


How about m--uh,


Fine Arts...
Aficionado Monthly?


No? Okay.


Well, could you get on that?


'Cause I don't
just read Cracked.


sighs
Thank you.


Okay.
See you soon.


What is he so excited about?


Michael's closing
on his condo today.


Ah.


Yesterday he asked me
if I'd go with him


as his associate.


And you said no?
Yeah.


He also asked me if I would cry
at his funeral.


What kind of shocks
you got on this baby?


I don't know.
Regular, normal ones.


Nothin' fancy.


Not my style.


What are you doin'?


I wanna put the top down.


No, Dwight.
It's 50 degrees outside.


Don't--Please.


Yeah, but then
no one can see us.


I--Just, would you
put it up?


Okay. Fine.


Just leave it down.


Whiner.


Check it out.


Terminator.


I do not understand
what you spend your money on.


Ooh.


(Jim)
Hey, Oscar.


On these new expense reports,


do we really have to go back
to last quarter?


Yeah.


It's a terrible system,
I know.


What?


What does "2005 season" mean?


Tha--laughs


Wait a minute.
What is this?


It's a scoreboard.


What?


Kevin and I play
this paper football game


when Michael's out.
Really?


Yeah.
Or when we're bored.


Oh, my God!


Wait, this goes back
two years!


We're bored a lot.


Oh-ho.
Oh!


Sweet.
Yes!


So close.


I really love the, uh,


paper triangle flicking
and hitting things game.


Yeah.
We call it Hateball.


Why?


Because of how much
Angela hates it.


Hey, do you guys have
any other games?


Sometimes we play


Who Can Put the Most m&ms
in Their Mouth?


(Angela)
You play that.


You should ask Toby


to teach you Dunderball.


Home sweet home.


Which one's yours?


Right there.


My sanctuary.


My party pad.


Someday I can just see


my grandkids


learning how to walk
out here.


Hang a swing
from this tree.


Push 'em back--


Wait.


No, it's this one
right here.


Home sweet home.


So it's like volleyball.
Okay.


Okay, you're gonna want to take
a hold of the ball.


Mm-hmm.
And you bounce it off


the wall
on your side of the tape.


Oh, okay--oh, so that's
what the tape's for.


I didn't know.


Yeah,
Michael asked about it once,


and I just pretended
not to hear him.


He left.


All right, let's play.


Kelly, do you mind
if I use your desk?


Yeah, go ahead.


Extra points
if you break his monitor.


Is that true, Toby?


It's not true.


It's my monitor.


And I'll just take Kelly's.


(Kelly)
Nice.


This is all mine.


All the way down,
around the corner.


It's a shared space,


but I can use it
whenever I want to.


Okay, so I called in
a favor


to my buddy
at the police department...


Ah, the volunteer
sheriff's station.


Same thing.
No.


Um, these are
the crime statistics


for the surrounding square mile
over the past four years.


Oh, anything bad?


Two charges of loitering.
Mm-hmm.


One noise complaint.


Several speeding tickets.
Mm-hmm.


Do you own a gun?
No.


I'd think about it.
Mm--I don't need a gun.


Hello?
Hello! How are you?


Okay.
I'm, uh, just about to close


on 126 over there.


And I guess
we're gonna be neighbors.


Very cool. Very cool.


So, uh--so what's the vibe?


What's the vibe
of this place?


Uh, I don't know.
It's pretty quiet.


Oh, rea--wow.
Ooh, that's gonna change.


laughs


Why?


Because...I loves to party.


And I'm gonna be partying my
butt off at this place.


Okay, but there's
an 11:00 noise curfew.


Hi, I'm Dwight Schrute,


Mr. Scott's associate.


Who's Mr. Scott?
Him.


I have a question
about the property line.


These two trees are pretty
close together,


but it looks to me like
this one's more on your side,


this one might be more on his.


Yeah.


What are you doing home
in the middle of the day?


I just came back for lunch.


What are you having?


Like a Hot Pocket.


What line of business
are you in?


I'm a salesman.


(Dwight)
Really? So am I.


Yeah?
What?


I sell yarn.


You're a yarn salesman?
Yeah.


I have a couple questions
about the neighborhood.


Have you had any problems
with prostitution,


crack dealing,
gang violence, etcetera?


groans
No.


Here's a question for you.
I have a convertible.


Is it safe to park that
in my driveway?


All right, see you soon.


A good guy.


Um...


cool.


So that's what
this sound is all day.


laughter


I think I'm going
to make myself


some microwave popcorn.


humming
La, la, da-da


Press Popcorn.
Oh, that's gonna be delicious.


I just love having popcorn
in the middle of the afternoon.


You know what?


I could do with some
hot chocolate as well.


Oh, drat,
I can't make hot chocolate


and popcorn at the same time,


unless I can!


Boom, second microwave
for "le hot chocolate"!


Hello, hello, hi.
Oh, Carol, hi, how are you?


Hey, Michael.
Good to see you.


Uh, Michael, this is Bill.


He's the head
of the Condo Association.


Oh!
Hey, how are you?


Nice to meet you, Bill.


Bill. Mr. Bill.


(as Mr. Bill)
Oh, no!


Mr. Bill!
Whoa! Ho-Ho!


SNL?


When they pull him apart?


He would always get
rolled over by something.


N-Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.


This is smaller
than your old place.


Yes, well, I'm buying it
and I'm not renting it.


So it's still an upgrade.


He doesn't know anything
about property ownership.


He's kind of an idiot.
Um...


(Dwight)
Actually, I do own property.


My grandfather left me


a 60-acre working beet farm.


I run it with my cousin Mose.


We sell beets
to local stores


and restaurants.


It's a nice little farm.


Sometimes teenagers
use it for sex.


Are we ready
to sign some papers?


Actually, no.


We have a couple of questions,


uh, about the neighborhood.


I-It's very safe.
It's very clean.


Uh, also, it's very accepting


of all lifestyles.


It's a very gay-friendly
neighborhood.


Oh, good.
That's good.


It's good to be
accommodating of...that.


Let's go check out
the master bedroom.


Hey, Phyllis.


Do you have any games
that you play in the office?


What do you mean?


You know, like,
little time killer games,


like stapler tennis
or something like that.


No.


Okay.


Stanley.


I just played Dunderball
with Toby.


What about you?
You got any games?


Yeah, I got a game.


It's called Work Hard
So My Kids Can Go To College.


Fair enough.


This, my friends,


is the master bedroom.


Check out
the cathedral ceilings.


Those are, like,
feet high.


We have cable readiness
right there.


I am going to totally
pimp this place out.


I am going to put
a surround sound system.


I am going to put
a plasma screen


right against this wall.


Ooh, terrible idea.


'Cause I'm putting my bed
right over here.


No, no, no, no, no.
This is a shared wall.


Neighbor throws
his wife into the wall,


plasma screen hits the floor,
totally smashed.


Well, then I will get
a warranty.


Warranties don't cover it.
Plus, they're a rip-off.


Well, then I won't
get a warranty.
Christina!


Shh!
So, that's the problem.
It's solved.


What?
I don't hear you practicing.


Can you hear that?


cello playing


Oh, man!


These babies are thin!


singing Olympic Anthem


This scented candle


imitating echo
--andle, --andle...


Which I found in the men's
bathroom, room, room...


Represents the eternal...


burning of competition
or something.


It smells like cookies.


Yes, it does.


Yes, it does, my friend.


Okay, we will be competing


for gold, silver, and bronze


yogurt lids.


Now, the bronze
are really blue.


And they're also
the backside of the gold,


so no flipping.


Okay?
Honor system.


(Angela)
I do play games.


I sing.


And I dangle things
in front of my cats.


I play lots of games.


Just not at work.


Let the games begin.


applause


all singing Olympic Anthem


Second bedroom, whoop!
For the ladies!


I mean, the extra ladies
who aren't in my bed


or for friends and family,
whoever wants to pop on by


to casa de Scott,
and right in here,


what's in here?


Uh-oh, bedroom number three.
What are we gonna do in there?


Limitless possibilities.
(Dwight)
Seal it off!


What?
What are you doing in there?


Fill it full of cotton
or soundproof insulation.


Oh, my God, Dwight!


Seal it off with drywall so you
don't hear Yo-Yo Ma over there.


Oh, you know what I might
do is I might make this


into a kid's room.


Kids, you don't even
have a girlfriend.


I will have a girlfriend
once she sees this place.


I'm gonna get married,
and I'm going to have kids.


(Dwight)
Well, that depends
on how old she is.


What if your girlfriend is 55?


I'm not gonna date
a 55-year-old woman.


Just a possibility.
No, it's not, just shut up!


If you fall in love with her.
You're an ass, shut it!


I smell mold.
No, you don't. Stop.


Living on a farm, your sense
of smell gets very sharp.


For example,
there are beets in a condo


two doors down that way, and...


someone over there I believe
is a big fan of olives.


And then I just need you
to sign here at this arrow.


What kind of mortgage
did you get?


Uh, 10-year.


Well, 10 over 30,


so 30-year total.


What? Wha--


You said 10. S--


10-year fixed...


over 30.


30-year total.


Huh. 30 years.


Okay, okay, okay.


Wow, you'll be payin' this off
in your mid 70s.


All right.
chuckles


Forget about retiring
when you're 65.


exhaling
Hey, I've got an idea.


You know that extra bedroom?


If the whole girlfriend thing
never happens,


that's where the nurse
can live.


Okay, all right.


Oh, boy.
Well, this is it.


Whenever you're ready.


Yeah. Um...


that's news to me,
the whole 30 years thing.


I think I was pretty clear
about that, Michael.


Moment of reckoning.
It's pretty standard.


All right, it's not
the moment of reckoning.


Just stop it.
This is not it.


This is--this--
there's a lot more.


(Dwight)
What is this if this isn't it?


Ho. Ho-okay.


Is that supposed to come off?


Actually, yes.
Hey, look, cool.
Carpenter ants.


Um...Gonna take
a little, uh, breather


for a second.


Excuse me.


It'll be here
waiting for you.


Oh, man.


(Dwight)
A 30-year mortgage


at Michael's age


essentially means that he's
buying a coffin.


If I were buying my coffin,


I would get one
with thicker walls


so you couldn't hear
the other dead people.


cello playing


breathing heavily


Oh!
Whenever you're ready, Michael.


Ugh!


No, this isn't it.


Not by a longshot.


You have what is
the national sport


of Icelandic paper companies.


And I'm blanking
on the name.


Could you help me out, Pam?


Jim, they refer to it as...


Flonkerton.


(Jim)
Hmm.


(Pam)
In English,


Box of Paper Snowshoe Racing.


Fair enough,


but I like Flonkerton.


The thing about Jim is,


when he's excited
about something,


like the office Olympics,


he gets really into it


and he does
a really great job.


But the problem with Jim


is that he works here,


so that hardly ever happens.


So who will be
challenging Kevin


in Flonkerton?


Anyone?


I'll do it.


Yes! Phyllis!


applause


Phyllis, if you'd just put
your foot right through here.


Right through the flonk.


I'm gonna back out of the deal.


Nothing personal,
but I feel like I have been


taken advantage of here.


How?
sniffs


This smells of fraud to me.


This whole thing
just kind of stinks.


The ceilings are lower
than they were last week.


That--I don't--


What?
I don't know if you showed me


this same unit or not.


Where--
Michael, this is
the unit you saw, and--


Where are all the hot people?


I was told that there would be


all these attractive singles.


Who told you that?
And as far as I can tell,


I'm the best-looking
person here.


(Michael)
There's a basic principle
in real estate


that you should never be


the best-looking person
in the development.


It's just sorta common sense,


because if you are,


then you have no place
to go but down.


Is this a financial thing?


If it's financial thing,


what some people do is, they
rent out the third bedroom.


No, no. No, no, no, no.


And that's some
extra income for you.


I am not going to rent
the third bedroom.


I want a price reduction
or I am a-walkin'.


You will lose $7,000
if you walk away right now.


Muh...


Mmm, mmm, mmm.


Cugino's,
what a great bread.


I made the right decision.


I'm glad I signed.


The--I'm a homeowner.


Right?


Good to be a homeowner.
Diversifying.


This is good.


This is fun.
We're havin' fun.


Totally havin' fun.


Can you imagine those poor saps


stuck at the office today?


both laughing


(Jim)
Here we go. Here we go.


cheering


Dig deep.


Dig deep!


screaming


Oh!


It's Phyllis!
It's Phyllis.


(Jim)
Phyllis by a nose.


Gold medal in Flurnenton.


Flonkerton!


(Jim)
Thank you,
delegate from Iceland.


(Jim)
Wow. Okay.


No one else should even try.


Gold medals.


cheering
Give him medals.


Wow!


cheers and applause


Ahh, so want to head back?


Yes.


Oh, and...


there's somethin' else, Dwight,


wanted to talk to you about.


I have a surprise for you.


For helpin' me out today.


Oh, you didn't have to do--
No.


No.
I insist, I insist.


Because you've really done
some great work.


Great work!


And that is why
I am going to let you


move into my third bedroom


and pay me rent.


gasps


Why did I do it?


Because I believe in rewarding
people for their efforts.


Uh, I rewarded Dwight


with the room,


and he is rewarding me back


with, uh, $500
plus utilities.


Let's just take a moment though


and make sure that this is
the right fit for you.


Why are you even saying that?


You don't have enough money.


Here's how we'll remedy that.
I can give you a raise.


And then we can have Dunder
Mifflin just pay for it.


That's not unethical because
Dwight does excellent work,


and he's earned it.


Thank you.


I guess my philosophy about
Dwight would be this:


If you can teach a man, Dwight,
to fish, room,


then he will learn,


pay $500 in rent,


how to fish, plus utilities.


I don't even know
what to say.


I'm thinkin', lock into
a four-year commitment.


We'll go month-to-month
after that.


Or until I start dating,


have a girlfriend.


And then you're, you know,


you're gone, so...


Question: Where can I put
my terrarium?


What hell is a terrarium?


It's a fish tank
for snakes and lizards.


Oh, so, an aquarium?


Uh, that...


will not come into this place.


Okay?
Question:


Oh, my God.


My grandparents left me


a large number of armoires.


Tell you what,
the deal will be off the table


in ten minutes,
so take it or leave it.


I've got a lot of work to do.


Oh, boy.


This whole condo's shifting.


It's like this place was built


on an ancient Indian
burial ground.


(Pam)
Are you sure you don't
wanna play?


(Angela)
I'm sure.


Come on, Angela.
Don't you have a game?


I have one, yes.


Well, let's play.
What is it?


I call it Pam Pong.


I count how many times
Jim gets up from his desk


and goes to reception
to talk to you.


We're friends.


Apparently.


(Jim)
Very nicely done.


Okay, so, think that's
H-O-R for Stanley


and H-O for Phyllis.


Are you calling me a ho?


Oh, my God.


Phyllis coming alive.
I like it.


Are you calling me a whore?


Stanley!
That is inappropriate, okay?


We just need to stop.


Everybody, let's get involved.


There are medals
to be won here.


Here we go.


Question:
What about carpooling?


Uh, who pays
for the gas?


We take separate cars.


Then question: Can sometimes
I drive your car


and you drive mine?


(Michael)
Why would we do that?


Just for fun?
No.


Question: Who's the primary
on the fire insurance?

Game over!


Offer revoked, Dwight.


I'm sorry,


but you reach out
and you try to be a nice guy


and help out a friend,


and this is what happens.


This is what I get.


I--God.


I'm--Okay.


Ooh.


(Dwight)
Thank God.


It was nice of him to offer.


But I live in a nine-bedroom
farmhouse.


I have my own
crossbow range.


It's a perfect situation
for me.


Although two bathrooms
would have been nice.


We just have the one.


And it's under the porch.

Ah!
Oh!


Who had somebody
from Vance Refrigeration?


Ryan Howard.

Ryan.


Gold medal.


I made something
for our closing ceremonies.


What?


Oh, my God!


Where'd you have time
to make that?


Automatic voice mail.


All right, Pam.
All right.


laughs


Nice work.


You know you can always
refinance your mortgage.


We had a 15-year
on our beet farm.


We paid it off early.


Yeah, well,
you know what?


Nobody cares
about your stupid beet farm.


Beets are the worst.


People love beets.
Nobody likes beets.


Everyone loves beets.


Nobody likes beets, Dwight!


Why don't you grow something
that everybody does like?


You should grow candy.


I'd love a piece
of candy right now.


Not a beet.


Let's get this roof goin'.


Stop it!
Ow!


Final lap!
Final lap!


(man)
Oscar!


(Jim)
Time to beat is 1:15.


Time to beat is one minute,
seconds.


Here they come!


cheering and urging


Guys?


(Dwight)
What is going on?


Nothing.


Guys? Timer still goin'?
Or--


That's my stopwatch.


Hey.
That was fun today.


Sorry we didn't get to
the closing ceremonies.


Yeah.


Thanks.


What...the hell?


There you go.
All done.


Great.


(Jim)
Yeah, I filled out
the expense reports.


That took about five minutes.


And then I closed two sales
at lunchtime.


So...about as productive
as any other day.


If not more so.


(Ryan)
I figured I could
throw it away now,


or I could keep it
for a couple of months


and then throw it away.


I mean, it was really nice
of Pam to make them,


but what am I gonna do
with a gold medal


made of paper clips
and an old yogurt lid?


Hey, Dwight.
Want to play a game?


No.


What kind of game?


I don't know.
Let's make one up.


Oh, and you can use your weird
rubber band ball if you want.


To do what?


I don't know, um...


oh, you know what?


Okay, I'll set up
these pencils,


and then you try
to knock them down.


It'll be like desk bowling
or something like that.


I'm really not in the mood
for games today, Jim.


Hey.


I have 59 voice mails.


Mm.


Hey, can you ignore those


and do something
for me instead?


Sure.


Okay.


Today, 5:00...


closing ceremonies.


Really?


Notify the athletes.


Cool.


knocking on door


Michael.


Yeah?
Jim. Slim Jim.


What's goin'--What's goin' on?


Nothin'. I just wanted to
congratulate you on your condo.


Oh, thanks.


Thanks. It's very cool.


It's, uh, three bedroom,
gay-friendly.


Nice.
You know.


Hey, would you mind
comin' out here for a second?


I just have something for you.


Really?


What's this?


There are
the closing ceremonies.


Step up.


W--Um...


You're on the top one.


Congratulations to Michael


because he closed on his condo.


So gold medal.


applause


I don't really know
what to say.


Um...


I'm not one
for making speeches,


but, uh...


my heart is very full
at this moment.


applause


And for Dwight Schrute,
the silver medal.


(Michael)
Get on up here, Dwight.


Silver medal.


Yep.
Not as good as gold.

Why are you playing
the national anthem?


Um, 'cause your condo's
in America.


Oh.


What the hell is that?


Those are the doves.

All right!


phone rings


- Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.


Sure, can I ask who's calling?


Just a second.


phone rings


- Jim Halpert.


What?
How did you get this number?


Stalker.


- Katie and Jim
met in the office.


And now I guess
they're, like, going out


or dating or something.


And, uh...


I don't know, you know?


They're just--she calls him
and they... you know.


I'm sorry, I feel like
I'm talking really loud.


Am I talking really loud?


- Katie and I have
been out a few times.


I wouldn't call her
my girlfriend,


but, yeah, I like her a lot.


She makes me laugh,


which I think is
really hard to find.


I mean, Dwight makes me
laugh, too, of course.


But Katie's a little cuter.


So we're still on for lunch?


You're meeting me here?


Okay.


Great. Bye.


- Hey, you can just
give her your extension.


- Okay.


upbeat piano music





- Howard/Ryan.


Ryan Howard is sitting
in my office.


And he has been a temp here
for a couple of months.


And he's kind of gotten
the lay of the land


a little bit,


had a few laughs along the way,


and now he wants to know
what I think.


- The temp agency
wants to know what you think.


- Shall we?
Let us proceed.


First up, proficiency
in necessary skills.


Eeeeeeaaa....


Excellent!


laughing


- Thank you.
- Oh, that--


I saw the sweat beading.


Okay, let's get serious.


Work ethic.


Mm, mm, not too shabby.


sing-song Not too shabby!


laughs
- Okay, uh,


it's excellent, satisfactory,


needs improvement,
or not applicable.


- Or not too shabby.
That's right there--


- Well, there's actually
a separate place for comments.


- I know, I know, I'll--
okay, excellent.


- At the bottom.
- It was exc--fine.


Excellent, excellent.
- Thank you.


- Um, social "integregation."


That's not ac--"accplicable."


- Michael's in there right now
evaluating the temp.


He hasn't evaluated me
in years.


- Attitude. Needs improvement.


- How can I improve that?


- Better already.


To be a boss, a good boss,


you have to have the ability
to recognize talent.


Including your own.


And one of mine,
one of my talents,


is being a mentor.


And, not kinda
the stuffy professor guy,


but s--fun.


Somebody fun.


And practical.


But fun.


But respected.


And loved.


Five years from now,
what do you wanna do?


Where do you wanna be?


- Uh, well, I'm interested
in business.


- Oh, good, ambitious.
Excellent.


Wanna be a manager?


- Uh, no, actually what I want


is to own my own company.


- That is ridiculous.
chuckles


Ryan's about to attend


the Michael Scott school
of business.


I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda
rolled into one.


as Yoda Much advice you seek.


Do you know who that is?


- Fozzie Bear?


- Mm.


No, that was Yoda.


Fozzie Bear.


Who could Fozzie Bear
possibly mentor?


Gonzo?


Animal?


Rowlf? Wha--I--


Ryan has a lot to learn.


- 70 and clear, that's nice.


Where's that?


- That's here.


- Really?


Wow.


- 63, 64, 65.


66, 67, 68.


69. restrained chuckle


70, 71, 72, 73.


There are ten rules of business


that you need to learn.


Number one:


you need to play to win...


but...


you also have to win to play.


- Got it.


- And I will give you the--


the rest of the ten at lunch.


Very nice.


Hey. clicks tongue


- Michael and I have
a very special connection.


He's like Batman,
I'm like Robin.


He's like The Lone Ranger,
and I'm like Tonto.


And it's not like there was
The Lone Ranger


and Tonto and Bonto.


Hey, how's it going, man?


- Good.


What's up?


- Oh, nothing much.
What's up with you?


- Uh, I'm good, thanks.


- Good. Good, I'm good, too.


Well, how's it crackin'?


- Uh, fine.


What's up?
- You know what you would love?


Guns N' Roses.


When I was your age,
I loved Guns N' Roses.


Do you like Guns N' Roses?


- Uh--
- I'll make you a tape.


- Cool.
- I'll make you two tapes.


- I don't have a tape player.


So--
- chuckles


Someday, temp.


I've got a couple of shirts
that don't fit so well anymore.


I'll bring 'em by.


Okay!


- Rule three,
reach for the stars.


And if you fail, see rule four.


Rule four,
failure is not an option.


- Got it.
Ryan is gonna love these.


- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!


And at the end, I will reveal


that they were
all just one rule.


- That is so cool.
- Mm-hmm.


- Plus you can go
"Rule five? See rule six.


"Rule six?


See rule five."
- No, I'm not trying


to trick him, I'm trying
to be a good mentor.


So--
- Kill or be killed.


- Mm, no.
- Shoot to kill.


Or, kill to shoot.


- No, come on, Dwight.


I have to have
ten of these by lunch.


I promised Ryan.


- Just ask for an extension.


- I'm not asking the temp
for an extension.


Unless I really need it.


- Michael and I have
a very special connection,


like an umbilical cord.


And the thing is, with Ryan,


is I don't want him
to trip on it or...


get it caught around his neck.


fire alarm ringing


People!
- Okay! Everybody?


- This is not a test.
Move to the exits.


- Do not panic!


Get up off your desks!
- No, I don't wanna hear it.


- Do not panic!
- Let's go people!


No, panic is warranted!


- Single file line.


- This is not a drill!


- Arms at your side!
Arms at your side!


- Please, move quickly.


This is a paper company,
people!


Step lively!


This whole place
is a tinderbox.


It is ready to blow.


This is not a test!
Can you leave?


- Oh, you say that
every time.


- Do you wanna die?!
- Oh, boy.


- Do you wanna die?!


- Let's go, let's go.
- Out!


Stanley,


have you ever seen
a burn victim?


Move to the exits!


- You're safety partners!
- Real smoke!


We've got smoke! Smoke!


Gah!


glass breaking


Oh, Kelly! Are you okay?
I gotcha!


- Hey, I'm all right!
- Cover your nose and mouth!


Breathe through your nose.
- Get off me!


Breathe through your nose.


Remove your stockings! Okay?


They'll melt
right into your flesh!


Stay below the smoke line.


Let's go!


Clear out, stat!


"Stat" means now!


- Yes, I was
the first one out.


A captain is always
the first one on the ship


and the last one off the ship.


And...


this parking lot is our ship


when the building is on fire.


So...


I ran out onto the ship.


And, yes, I've heard
"women and children first."


But we do not employ children.


We are not a sweatshop,
thankfully.


And women are equal


in the workplace by law.


So, I let them out first,


I have a lawsuit on my hands.


Another rule of business


is being able to adapt
to different situations.


- Yeah?


- Adapt, react, readapt...


Apt. Right?
That's rule number two.


- Okay, guys, listen up.
We need a headcount.


We need to count off.
Michael's number one.


Where is he? Where is he?


- So what was rule two?


- Uh, adapt, react,
readapt, apt.


- Okay, well,
let's just kinda


take it a little slower.
- Hey, Michael,


uh, Ryan needs a number
for the count off.


- Okay, uh,
well, one is taken.


- Uh, okay, two?


- No!
- Okay--uh, sorry.


- Okay, he can have 14.
Margery's not here today.


- Well, he needs a
permanent number, all right?


- No, I don't.


- Oh, you know what else?


I thought of a nickname
for the three of us.


Three musketeers.


- Um, yeah, okay.


That--no, no, no, no!
I got one, I got one.


The three stooges.


- That's funny, too.


But if we're
the three musketeers...


- I don't wanna be, like,


a guy here, you know?


Like, Stanley is
the crossword puzzle guy.


And Angela has cats.


I don't wanna have
a thing here, you know?


I don't wanna be


the something guy.


- Okay, you know what?


I think I'm gonna be
setting the agenda here, okay?


Everybody gather up, please.


Important announcement.
Very important announcement.


I think this is
a perfect opportunity


for all of us to participate


in some really intense,


psychologically revealing
conversations.


So we're gonna be playing
Desert Island,


um, "Who Would You Do?"


And, um...
- "Would You Rather?"


- "Would You Rather?"


"Would You Rather?"
is our third game.


fire truck horn


siren blares


- Yeah!


Hey, guys, great response time.


Listen up. I got some theories.


Okay, there's a...


I'm a safety officer.


I'm a volunteer
sheriff's deputy.


And I know that when
there's a dangerous situation--


look, I have been training
my whole life for this.


There may be fire


inside the walls right now.


- Yes, there is a real fire.


But it's okay.


Everyone got out fine.


This is why you
practice these things.


- I like fire drills.


You know what's the greatest?


Like, when you were in school


and the teacher would let you
have class outside.


- Oh, the best.


- Yeah, it was great because


it was like
you're supposed to be working,


but nothing ever gets done.


- Yeah, we had outside classes
all the time


and we never did anything.
- laughs


- Actually, if I had
had fewer outside classes,


I probably wouldn't be


stuck here at a paper company.


- You're not stuck.


- Okay, so, three books
on a desert island.


Angela.


- The Bible.


- That's one book.


You've got two others.


- Uh, "Purpose Driven Life."


- Nice.


Third book.
- No.


- Okay, Phyllis.


- Um, "The Da Vinci Code."


- "The Da Vinci Code."


I would take
"The Da Vinci Code"


so I could burn
"The Da Vinci Code."


- Okay, great, that's gonna


keep you warm
for, like, seven seconds.


Question, is there firewood
on the island?


- I guess.


- Then I would bring
an axe, no books.


- No, it has to be
a book, Dwight.


- Fine,
"Physician's Desk Reference."


- Nice, smart.
- Hollowed out.


Inside, waterproof matches,


iodine tablets.


Beet seeds, protein bars,
NASA blanket.


And...


in case I get bored,


"Harry Potter and
the Sorcerer's Stone."


No, "Harry Potter and
the Prisoner of Azkaban."


Question, did my shoes
come off in the plane crash?


- Plane crash?


- This is important.


Leather is a food source.


- No, it's not.
- Leather from shoes


can be boiled down
to a simple broth


that can sustain a man
for over two weeks.


- You just made that up.


- Question, are there
animals on the island?


- Rule number four.


"In business,
image is everything."


Andre Agassi.


This car is
an investment, right?


If I have to take out a client.


Or I'm seen
around Scranton in it.


I love it. I love this car.


Do you like it?


- Yeah.


- Okay, I thought people
read more books.


DVDs. Five movies.


What would you bring
to the island?


Toby, go ahead.
- Um, "Say Anything,"


"The Shining."


Uh, "Annie Hall."
That's too obvious.


- Those are like
my favorite movies.


I didn't really think
you could win Desert Island,


but I think you just did.


- Oh, "Toy Story 2."


One of the best movies
I ever saw.


I went for my daughter.


And stayed because


you can't leave your daughter
in a theater.


- Toby and I
used to sit together.


Until Michael moved us


because he thought
we talked too much.


- Really?
- Yeah.


- Can I go next?


- Yes, Meredith.


- "Legends of the Fall,"


"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"


"Legally Blonde,"


"Bridges of Madison County."


- Wow.


"Legends of the Fall."
- Wow.


"Bridges of Madison County,"
"Legally Blonde."


These movies are just--
- Well, I kind of like...


- Wait, wait, wait.
Pam, no.


Do you understand?


The game is
desert island movies,


not guilty pleasure movies.


Desert island movies are
the movies you're gonna watch


for the rest of your life!


Forever!


Unforgivable.
- I take it back.


- Unforgivable.
- I take it back!


- Good.


- And "Ghost."


But, uh, just that one scene.


You know that scene?
- Yeah, yes.


- Yeah, I know that scene.
- That was a good scene.


Um, Kevin.


Do it.


- Uh, "Cannonball Run,"


"Cannonball Run 2,"


"Weekend--" snickers


"Weekend at Bernie's,"


"Weekend at Bernie's 2,"


and--ooh, "Groundhog Day."


- "Groundhog Day."


- I have a client
who watches that movie


once a week at least.


- Really?
- I should put you


in touch with him.


Maybe we could get together


and work on that account?


- I would love that.
- Okay, guys, guys, guys.


That almost sounded
like business,


and we are trying
to focus here today, okay?


- Is this your car, Ryan?


- Wow, some pretty big


books back there, huh?
- Don't.


- Good shocks.
- Hello, Mr. Egghead.


Beep!


I'm just kidding.


I read a lot. Lot of, uh,


lot of suspense thrillers,


lot of business books.
- Yeah.


- Funny story, I got this book


"Who Moved My Cheese?"


It's a great business book.
- Right.


- But I bought it
because I thought it


was a suspense thriller.


Oh, Stanley Kaplan, I know him.


"M is for Murder," "P is for--"
- That's actually a


test prep book.
- "for Phone." What?


- That's a test prep
for business school.


- Oh, thinking
about business school.


- I just got in.
I applied.


I go at night.
- Really?


So, you think you know
a lot about business?


- No, not yet.


Just started.
- Uh-huh, yeah.


Quiz me.


- I wouldn't even know--
- Oh, come on.


Come on, Egghead.


Let's do it.
- Do it.


- Quiz me up.
- All right, um...


Why have people been rethinking
the Microsoft model


in the past few years?


- When I was Ryan's age,


I worked
in a fast food restaurant


to save up money for school.


And then I


lost it in a pyramid scheme.


But I learned more
about business


right then and there


than business school
would ever teach me


or Ryan would ever teach me.


- When the dollar goes up,


what does that do
to American business?


- Pass.
- Up.


- Um, right.
- Pass.


- When I was Ryan's age,


I worked selling cutlery
for a while.


Cutlery that could
decimate a penny,


I kid you not.


There were these shears
that could cut


straight through a penny.


So, I have life experience


and work experience


that Ryan doesn't


and will never have.


- Is it cheaper
to sign a new customer


or to keep
an existing customer?


- Keep an existing--
- Shut...it.


Can I just do it please?


Uh, it's equal.


- It is ten times
more expensive


to sign a new customer.
- Okay, yes.


It was a trick question.
- Yeah, but look.


I mean, he didn't need
business school, okay?


Michael comes from
the school of hard knocks.


- Okay, Dwight?
- Self-taught.


You didn't even go to college.
- You know what?


You don't need
to help me here, okay?


You know, maybe you should
go to business school


like Ryan.


Then you'd know what


you're talking about.
- Come on,


I'm studying
with a master, huh?


You should learn
from him, right?


Right?
- Stop, Dwight.


You know what, Dwight?
You're acting like a dork.


Would you cool it, please?
- grunts


Okay.
- Ooh!


Hey, he's not your
five-year-old brother, Dwight.


He's a valued member
of this company.


- No, I--
And you know what?


He knows more about business
than you ever will.


- Stupid.


- I did not go
to business school.


You know who else
didn't go to business school?


LeBron James, Tracy McGrady.


Kobe Bryant.


They went right from
high school to the NBA.


So...


so it's not
the same thing at all.


Look at this stuff.


Market fragments.
What is that supposed to be?


It's a way of looking
at consumers as subsets


of a larger client base.


- Do you have a pen?


- Uh, not on me.


Here, um, two shoe salesmen
go into the jungle, okay?


- Yeah.


- On the first day,
they realize


no one in the jungle
wears shoes.


- All right.
- So the first salesman


calls his boss, says,


"Nobody wears shoes.
Get me out of here."


- I'm a boss.
I, uh, I say, "Okay,


but first you have to
reimburse me for your travel--"


- No, you're
the second salesman.


You say,
"Nobody down here wears shoes.


It's a totally
untapped market."


- You are so smart.


You are so F-ing smart.


You should be teaching me.


Well, I'm smart enough
to know what I don't know.


Which is apparently everything.


- Pam, get us back into it.


Five movies, go ahead.
- Okay, um, "Fargo."


Um, "Edward Scissorhands,"
"Dazed and Confused."


- Ooh, definitely
in my top five.


- Yes, in my top three,
so suck it.


"Breakfast Club."


Um, "The Princess Bride."
- Okay, that's five.


loud snapping
- No, my all-time favorite!


- Pam, play by the rules.
- All-time favorite.


Play by the rules.


Dwight.


All-time favorite movie.


- "The Crow."


engine revving


tires squealing


- I became a salesman


because of people.


I love making friends.


But then I was
promoted to manager


at a very young age.


And I still try
to be a friend first.


But, you know...


When you're very successful,


your co-workers
look at you differently.


sighs


What do you think?


- Maybe we should get some air.


- No, I'm okay.


- I'm really uncomfortable.


- All right, let's move on.


Let's move on
to the main event.


Who would you do?
- Present company excluded?


- Um, not necessarily.
- Pam.


- Pam.


- Um...


Okay, uh, you know what?
Maybe I'll--


I'll finish explaining
the rules.


Let me explain it first
and then...


- Think you've
had too much


- Yeah, so we'll get right--


you know what?
I'll be right back.


Stanley, you're taking over
for me, buddy.


I'll be right back.
- Okay, um...


"Everybody Hurts"
by R.E.M. continues


- Dwight.
- Everybody hurts


music plays louder
- Dwight.


Come on, Dwight, use words.


- Sometimes--


- Why didn't I go
to business school?


- Who goes to business school?


- The temp.
- He does?


- Yeah, it's all him and
Michael talk about anymore.


- You know, I bet Ryan
thinks to himself,


"I wish I were a volunteer
sheriff on the weekend."


- He doesn't even know
that I do that.


- You should tell him.


- Oh, yeah, Pam, right.


That's gonna help things,
just talk it out.


I hope the war goes on forever


and Ryan gets drafted.


- Dwight.
- What?


- I'm sorry I said that.
I didn't--


just part of me meant it.


Besides, he'd end up
being a hero, anyway.


- You know what
you should do?


You should quit.


And then, that would
stick it to both of them.


- No, Jim,
I'm not gonna quit.


Then Ryan wins.


- Yeah, you're right.


- Thanks, you guys.


I just need some alone time.


- Okay.


- All right, buddy.
- Everybody cries...


both laugh


- Hey.


Guys, what's going on?
- Hey.


- Nothin'.
- What's up?


Can I hang with you guys
for a bit?


The warehouse guys are


a bunch of jackasses sometimes.


- Boobs.


- What question
are you responding to?


Come on, people, you know
the rules of the game.


- Oh, hey, hey, game?


What game are we playing here?


- Okay, it's called
"Who Would You Do?"


- Oh!


I play this at home
all the time


while I'm falling asleep.


What, uh--where are we?


Where are we here?
- Roy.


- Roy? Roy?


Who would you do, Roy?
- Uh...


Oh, I got it!


What's the name of that, uh,


tight-ass Christian chick?


The blonde?


- My name is Angela.


- Hey, Angela. Roy.


Nice to meet you.


- All right, who's next?
Who's next?


Who's next? Who's--Jim?


You're next.
Who would you do?


- Um...


Kevin, hands down. Yeah.
group laughing


He's really got that teddy bear
thing going on and...


Afterwards, we could
just watch bowling.


- chuckles


- Well, I would definitely


have sex with Ryan.


'Cause he is gonna
own his own business.


- You're all gay.
cackles


- Who's, uh, who's next?
Who we got?


phone ringing


Who?
- Hey.


No, I can talk, I can talk.
I can talk.


- Well, wish I had
my cell phone,


but I left it inside, so...


- Would that make you happy?


- What's that?
- If you had your cell phone?


Would it make you happy?
- Yeah.


- I'm on it.
- Dwight, hey!


- You can't go back in yet!
- Dwight, don't!


- He is an idiot.


The man is an idiot,
ladies and gentlemen.


- What if he dies in the fire,


and that's the last thing
you ever said to him?


I didn't say it to him,
I said it about him.


- And then you go to school


for three years?
- For two years,


and it's only at night,


and then it's on
your résumé forever.


- Wow.


And just out of curiosity,


how much is it?
- 650 bucks.


- A semester?
- A credit.


- Wow.
- It's an investment.


- No, yeah, sounds like it.


- I think it's worth it.


- Jim.
- Definitely Jim.


- Definitely, definitely Jim.


- Come on, Pam.
- What about you, Pam?


- Um...


Oscar's kind of cute.


- Yeah, I like Oscar.


- Ooh, Toby.


- How long does it take


to find a cell phone?


I don't know either.
- Um, is there anybody else?


- clears throat


- Hey, where are you?
Oh, good.


Yeah, we're just here.
We're playing Desert Island.


It's where you pick
your five favorite DVDs.


- Seriously,
where the hell is Dwight?


clears throat Hey.
- I don't know.


Call my cell phone.


It'll make it easier
for him to find.


- What's your number?


- I gave it to you in the car.


- Um...
- I saw you program it in.


- You gotta--you gotta
give it to me again.


- Okay, all right.


- Now, I have it.


cell phone playing "Mambo #5"


- Uh...


I better tell somebody.


Excuse me, sir?
- coughing


- Dwight! Dwight!


God, man, why did you
go in there?


Everybody was scared
out of their wits, man.


- Everyone, okay.


Uh... I have an announcement.


Apparently, in business school,


they don't teach you
how to operate


a toaster oven.


Because some smart, sexy temp


left his cheese pita


on oven instead of timing it


for the toaster thing!


laughing


- Oh, wow! Okay.


Well, I guess they don't teach


how to operate a toaster oven
in business school--


- That's exactly what I said!


- Hey, did you miss that day,
there, Ryan?


- Were you absent?
- "Toaster Oven 101"?


- You failed?
- I am so sorry.


- Oh, man.


Hey, I know what'll
impress everybody.


I'll start a fire.


Oh, man.


Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.


- I have a song--
attention everyone--


that I wanna sing.


That I wrote especially
for this occasion


when I was up there
among the flames.


Ready?


Ryan started the fire


It was always burning since
the world's been turning


both: Ryan started the fire


It was always
burning since--


- Everybody!


- I can't believe
I started the fire.


both: mumbling lyrics


- Marilyn Monroe


both: Ryan started the fire


It was always burning...


- Eat it!


Eat it! He has to eat it!
- Hi!


- Hey.
- How are you?


- Good, how are you?
- I'm good.


- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you too.


- I'm hungry.
- Yeah, I am too.


- Oh, I have been thinking


the whole way over,


and I have my answers.
- What answers?


- Uh, for the desert island.


- Oh, right!
Right, right, right!


Come on, come on.


Ladies and gentlemen,
gather 'round.


We have one more participant.


Come on, be polite.


Be polite.


Desert island, five movies, go.


- Okay, um, first,


"Legally Blonde."


- laughs


I forgot what
a super nice girl Katie is.


And, just--good for Jim.


They are so cute together.


And, um, what an adorable car!


- Okay!


I think the game's over.


People are, like, leaving.


There was
a bigger crowd last time.


Do you wanna just go to lunch?
- Okay.


- Yeah?
- All right, you wanna drive?


- Sure.
- All right.


They are so cute.


- I'm really sorry, Dwight.


- Answer me this, though.
- What?


- Was it worth it?


Was it worth it, temp?
- No.


- Was it worth it?
- Really?


- I'm really sorry, Dwight.


- The fire guy.
laughs


The fire guy!


Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon

North Korea, South Korea


Marilyn Monroe


Ryan started the fire


- Okay, rule five,
safety first,


i.e., don't burn
the building down, okay?


That should be a no-brainer.


Oh, look...


Ryan is book smart.


And I am street smart.


And book smart.


I'll give you the rest
of the ten tomorrow.


- I'm Michael's number two.
He's one, I'm two.


He's alpha, I'm beta.


He's A, I'm B.


It's easy.


Whatever Michael is,
I'm one less.


I am Michael's right-hand man.


And he doesn't need
another right-hand man


because he's only got
one right arm.


I know Michael's every move.


It's not something
you can just pick up.


I could write a book about him.


Literally.


I started one once,


but Michael made me stop.


- If I could change
the life of one person,


just one person,


I--actually,
that's shooting kinda low.


I already did that.


When I was born.


Changed two people's lives.


Mom and Dad.


Um...


if I could change
the lives of 5,000 people,


10,000,


nah, five.


I'd be satisfied with 5,000.


I--10,000 though,


that'd be something.


Wow, 10,000 people.


Because you know what?
Even one is amazing.


door closes


Where is my desk?


That is weird.


This is not funny.
This is totally unprofessional.


Okay. Well, you're the one
who lost the desk.


I didn't lose
my desk.


Okay, calm down.


Where was the last place
you saw it?


Okay, who moved
my desk?


I think you should retrace
your steps.


Okay, I am going


to tell Michael,


and this entire office
will be punished.


Colder.


Warmer.


Little warmer.


There you go.
Ooh, warmer.


Warmer.


Warmer.


Warmer. Warmer.


Cold. Cold. Cold.

Ooh. Ooh. Warmer.


Hot. Red hot. Hot.


Very hot.

Dwight Schrute.


Hi, Dwight.


Um, what sort of discounts
are we giving


on the 20 pound white?


Jim, I've given you this
information, like, 20 times.


I know.


toilet flushes


It's by the ream?


Uh, yeah.


It is now 9.78.


So it's a discount of 7%.


Okay, thank you.
Gotta get back to work.


Wash your hands, Kevin.


upbeat music





Right.


Oh, well, let me just
check the pricing list.


Hold on one second.
Sensei.


Hello, it's sempai.


Dwight.


You know what, let me
give you a call right back.


I'm going to find it
and then I'll call you back.


Thanks.


Yes, I just had a ques--


Yes, sensei.


Arigato gozaimashita.


Hai.


Was that your mom?


No. That was my sensei.


Oh, thought it was
your mom.


I am now sempai,


which is assistant sensei.


Assistant to the sensei,
that's pretty cool.


Assistant sensei.
Okay.


I am a practitioner
of Goju-Ryu Karate


here in Scranton.


(all)
Huh!


2.
(all)
Huh!


Dwight,
stamp and kick back. 3.


(all)
Huh!


My sensei, Ira,


recently promoted me
to purple belt


and gave me the duties
of a sempai.


Not that a lot of people
here in America


know what a sempai is.


But it's equally as respected
as a sensei.


Huh!
Great.


Huh!
Excellent.


Huh!
That's okay.


Huh!
Good.


Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.


pager beeping


Sorry, just one sec--
Dwight--


Dwight, you can't use your
pager in here, I told you.


Okay, it's just--
it's a sales call.


Dwight, ten push-ups.


Ten push-ups!


I can--
Yes, sensei!


Go!


One, two.
And snap, okay?


Now, Dwight got hurt
last week, all right?


It's because we didn't
pull our kicks back.


When we fight in-class,
we don't fight full-contact.


From now on, not full-contact
with Dwight, okay?


(Dwight)
Do I feel bad that I haven't


bonded with the other students?


No, I'm not there
to make friends.


I'm there to attack people.


I don't want to stay
until 7:00 again this year.


I don't really have
any control over that, Stanley.


Michael tends
to procrastinate a bit


whenever he has to do work.


Um, time cards.


He has to sign these
every Friday.


Purchase orders
have to be approved


at the end of every month.


And expense reports.


All he has to do
is initial these


at the end of every quarter.


But once a year, it all falls
on the same Friday.


And that's today.


I call it
the perfect storm.


I don't want to work
clinking mug with finger


I just want to bang
on this mug all day


Did you ask me here
for any specific reason?


Ah, yes. I did.


Here's the dizzle.


I have a very top secret
mission for you.


I want you to update all the
emergency contact information.


Why is that secret?


knock at door


(Michael)
Hello. Oh, God.


Busy work. Get away.
Get away.


Ah, cretin.


Um, I put stickers
so you know where to sign.


Yes, thanks.
I know where to sign.


It's just that last year,
you--


Last year,
they were out of order,


weren't they, Pam?


Well, the last pickup
for overnight deliveries


is at 7:00, so you need
to have them signed by then


or much earlier.


Chillax, Pam.
Stop Pam-MSing.


That's pretty good.


Um, actually,
I'm sending Ryan


on a top secret mission.


Tell her what it is.


Updating emergency contacts.


Well, is that really
a priority?


(Michael)
Is it a priority?


Oh, I don't know.


Um, what if there's
a tornado, Pam?


People's legs are crushed
under rubble.


Please, would you be so kind
as to call my wife?


No. I can't.


Because we don't have any
emergency contact information


because Pam said
it wasn't a priority.


Think.
Think with your head, Pam.


Okay, well, she walks out.


That's the problem
with being a boss


is that when you are tough,
they resent you


and when you are cool,
they walk all over you.


Catch-22.


Catch-22. Yes.


Why don't you give me


your contact information
to start with, okay?


What's your cell?


Uh, Larisa Halpert.


What's her address?


cell phone rings
Von Bergen Street.


Hello.


Michael in high voice
Hey, Ryan.

This is Michael Jackson


calling from Wonderland.


You mean Neverland?


This is Tito.


laughing


What?


Calling from--


Your major and minor lines


cross at a ridge.


That sucks.


You're making this up
as you go along, aren't you?


I am just following
the website.


Well...


at least I don't
have cavities.


Yes, you have
very nice teeth.


Thanks.


Who's your
emergency contact?


Stacey.

Hello?


Michael in high voice
This is Mike Tyson.


laughs


TGIF.


Thank God it's Friday.


Mm.


Are you going
to happy hour later?


Ugh, I'm still recovering
from last night.


Ah.


But maybe.


Hey, Dwight.


As sempai, do you ever think
there's gonna be a day


where humans and robots
can peacefully coexist?


Impossible.


The way they're programmed...


You're mocking me.
No, I'm not.


Well, let me offer you
a little piece of advice.


I am not afraid
to make an example out of you.


Well, that's not advice.


What advice sounds like
is this.


Um, don't ever bring
your purple belt to work


because someone might
steal it.


Okay, give that back
to me.


Okay, say please.


No. That is not a toy.


Please.
Please.


Good. And it absolutely
is a toy.


Arigato.
Arigato.


This is not a toy.


This is a message


for the entire office
so that everyone


could see
that I am capable


of physically
dominating them.

And this is more
of a yin-yang thing.


The Michael is all cursive,
Scott all caps.


Left brain, right brain.


Or a duality of man.


knock on glass


Could you practice
on the forms?


groans softly


What about Oscar?


Could you beat Oscar?
No problem.


(Jim)
Oh, no,
he looks pretty scrappy.


(Dwight)
Unless he has a shiv,


in which case
it wouldn't be a fair fight.


True.
Meredith?


No women or children
unless provoked.


Okay. Roy.


Warehouse guy.
Doesn't count.


Okay. Michael.
Could you beat up Michael?


Yeah, I don't think
that would happen.


'Cause we're friends.


Because I would
kick his ass.


Well, Dwight's
purple belt, so...


So? I've beat up
black belts. Yeah.


How'd you know
they were black belts?


They told me after.


See, I used to run
with a very tough crowd,


street fighter types.


Real, real bad people.


I'm just lucky I got out.


I was a badass mofo.


Stanley knows
what I'm talking about.


Excuse me?


Never lost a fight.
You know why?


My motto.
Never say die.


You just said it.
You just said it.


No, that's not how
I meant it.


He just--
No.


You said it.
Shut up, Dwight.


breathes deeply


Do you think
he signed them yet?


Signed what?


Forget it.


Is that
chocolate vanilla swirl?


Just chocolate.


Angela, for the last time,


I did not eat your
chocolate vanilla swirl.


Don't look at me.


I don't know why
I write my name on things.


sighs


Is your wife
still your contact?


Uh, ex-wife, yeah.


Uh, her last name
is Becker now.


Okay.


You don't need
to write "ex".


(Michael)
And after that,


nobody ever messed with
the damn rascals ever again.


Sounds tough.


When you're a Jet,


you're a Jet all the way,
right?
You're a Jet?


Have you signed
the expense reports yet?


Yes, in theory I have.


I just need to cross
some Ts and dot some Is.


All right.


I am going to be
in my office,


if anybody needs me.


Hoo! Ha!


Oh, wow.
Michael.


Sleeper hold.
Bed time for vato.


Oh.


(Dwight)
Stop it.


(Michael)
Oh ho ho ho.


You are the weakest link.


Ow!


I'm friends with everybody
in this office.


We're all best friends.
I love everybody here.


But sometimes
your best friends


start coming in
to work late


and start having dentist
appointments


that aren't dentist
appointments.


And that is when it's nice
to let them know


that you could
beat them up.


Just hit me.
You'll see.


I can't.


'Cause I just got a manicure,
so...


Oh, queer!
Eye. Queer Eye.


That's a good show.
Important show.


Go ahead. Do it.


Just have Dwight punch you.


Oh, yeah. Well, that would
be kind of worthless


because I know
a ton of 14-year-old girls


who could kick his ass.


You know a ton
of 14-year-old girls?


Look. Dwight is a wuss.


When we rented Armageddon,


he cried at the end of it.


No, Michael,
I told you.


That was because
it was New Year's Eve


and it started to snow
at exactly midnight.


mock crying
Bruce Willis.


They're going to leave him
on the asteroid.


Okay, I'll punch you.


Oh, okay.
Here we go.


All right. Come on.


Gah!


coughs, gags


inhaling deeply
Oh!


Did I want to harm Michael,


the one man
I've been hired to protect?


No, I did not.


Are you okay?


hoarse Yes.


Are you sure
you're all right?


Yeah. Yeah.


Thank you.


I come from a long line
of fighters.


My maternal grandfather


was the toughest guy
I ever knew.


World War II veteran.


Killed 20 men
then spent the rest of the war


in an allied prison camp.


My father battled


blood pressure and obesity
all his life.


Different kind of fight.


Still noble.


If I come for you--


'cause your cartilage
can go right through.


Okay, take this pen
and stab me with it.


Okay, he has
to be stopped.


Please, please, please,
please, just ask Michael.


indistinct chatter


I don't know.


Ha.


Okay. I'll buy you
a bag of chips.


French onion?


Obviously.
Why are you spinning
around?


Okay.
Yes.


Take this pen, okay?


Stab me with it.


(Michael)
Go away.


I just have
a quick question.


I haven't signed them,
okay?


No, it's not that.


Um, I was just wondering,


since I'm probably going
to have to stay late,


could you ask Dwight
to stay late too


so he can walk me
to my car?


Come in.


Uh, Pam,


I hate to break this
to you,


but Dwight can't stop you
from being mugged.


He's just not
tough enough.


He's a purple belt.
That's really high.


Oh, I could beat up Dwight.
That's ridiculous.


I can murder him.


It's just that out there,
you...


Oh, is that what
they're saying?


Yeah, kind of.
Okay. All right.


Where's Dwight?
Uh, kitchen.


Okay.


(Dwight)
Try it again. Here we go.


Hi-yah!
Good.


Wow, it was actually
pretty close, right?


Excellent. Now watch.
Let me take you from behind.


What?
(Michael)
Watch out, Kelly.


He might sucker punch you.


I didn't sucker punch you,
Michael.


No, really?


In case you didn't remember,
I was defending my honor.


Like a samurai.
Really?


Yeah.
Well, the offer,
Dwight,


was for one punch,
which I absorbed.


I had no idea that there'd be
a second punch.


So catch-22.


(Dwight)
Okay, fine. Tit for tit.


Give it your best shot.
Two punches. Go.


Look. If we were in a bar
right now,


there would be two punches.


Me punching you
and you hitting the floor.


No, I'd block
your first punch


rendering you ineffective.
Oh, really?


Yeah.
You know what,


you're just lucky
that we're at work right now.


Ooh, what about
Dwight's dojo?


No, they just have classes.


It's free during the day.
It's fine.


I've got the key.
Hey, Michael.


Hey, Toby.
Any word
on those time cards?


Hey, you know what?
I have an idea.


Why don't you leave
right now?


Why don't you walk
away from the room, okay?


Fine.


We'll go at lunch.


Pam, make an announcement.


Figure out carpools.


He's leaving the office?


I know...
You gotta be kidding me.


(Jim)
Um, well, we're all
getting excited


to see this fight.


The Albany Branch is working
right through lunch


to prevent downsizing.


But Michael, he decided
to extend our lunch


by an hour so that we could
all go down to the dojo


and watch him fight Dwight.


Fight. Fight. Fight.
Fight. Fight. Fight.


Fight. I'm coming. Fight.


Sorry.


elevator dings


I recognize that.


That is Japanese
for California roll.


Uh, no, it's not.


I think it is.
A guy told me about that.


Actually, it's a symbol
for eternal discipline.


Oh.


Your shoes.
Yes?


You're gonna have
to take 'em off.


It's a sign of respect.


Oh.


Well, in my office
if you took off your shoes,


it would be a sign
of disrespect.


Stinky feet feel.
Kind of a yin-yang.


Hoo-ch-ch-ch-cha!


Ch-ch-ch-ch-cha!


Oh, stretching.

Here's your gear.


Please put this on.


Do you have, uh,


do you have anything
in, like, black?


No, just white.
All right.


Wow. That is really
interesting.


What?


Your love l--
I'm just kidding.


I can't see anything.


Look closer.


Okay.
One point for me.


Tied up.
Oh, you're dead.


What? What are you
going to do?


Bring it, Beesly.
Bring it.


Ooh, yeah. Good move.


Ooh, not such
an ultimate fighter now, huh?


Oh, put me down.


laughing
Put me down.


Oh my God.
Hey, put me down.


Hey.


You ready?


Okay, gentlemen, listen up.


After a clean strike
to the chest,


stomach, or kidneys,


I will separate you
and award a point.


First person
to three wins, all right?


Yes, sensei.
Lot of rules.


Lot of rules. On the street,
we didn't have any rules.


Maybe one. No kicks
to the groin.


Home for dinner.


Hi, sensei!
Hi, Dwight!


That's Alyssa, my sempai.


She just qualified
for regionals.


Osu!


Alyssa?


I guess she's technically
the sempai.


But nobody really respects her.


The only reason she got into
regionals


was because her competition was
a bunch of 13-year-old girls.


scoffs


Put me in that division.


Let's see how she does.


Hajime!
Ha-yah!


Whoa, hey!
What the hell was that?


(Sensei)
Dwight.
Yes!


No way.

All right. That's the way you
want to do it?


Two more!
You want to play dirty, huh?
Okay, game on, man.


Sweep the leg.


I'm coming
at you, man.


exhaling briskly


Ha!
Okay, purple belt.


Okay.
I got it.


No.
I got his pants.


That was my pants.
No points for pants.


Dwight, you have--
No, look.


No, you have something.
You have something.


God, you look like such
an idiot.

I went medieval on his hiney.


Okay, are those

how to do your job, do I?


Look, I just wanna have a job,
Michael.


If we don't get these
purchase orders--

You're not gonna downsize

with part one.


This is what you had Ryan do.


Yes, under my tutelage.


But what about the other stuff?
That has to be in today.


If you didn't badger me
with so many questions, Pam,


I could be done with it
by now.


Dwight.


Michael,
did you finish yet?


This close. Dwight, may I
speak with you for a minute?


Uh, I'm busy.


Well, busier.
But I'm making the time.


Michael, can't your
conversation wait till Monday?


We want to go home.


Well, you don't even have
anybody to go home to, Toby.


The shipping place closes
in a half hour.


I know. But I've been carrying
the load on my back all day.


And if everyone would just
chip in a little bit,


might help me out.


What do you say?


Let's gang bang
this thing and go home.


Good? Dwight.


This is illegal.


I don't care.


I have been testing you
the entire day.


Did you know that?


Of course.


And I'm happy to say
that you passed.


So effective immediately,


I am promoting you


from assistant
to the regional manager


to assistant
regional manager.


gasps


Michael...


I don't know--


I know. I know. I know.
I know.


I wouldn't be offering it


if I didn't think
you could handle it.


I can handle it.
I can.


I know. Okay.


sighs
Wow.


So I guess this'll
just be my office.


No.


No. Title change only.


I'll have Pam
send out a memo.


No. No. Three month
probationary period.


Let's just not tell anybody
about this right now.


Just a formality?


Absolutely.
But not really.


Michael...


I have so much
to learn from you.


Yes, you do.


Thank you...


sensei.


And ditto.


I told Dwight


that there is honor
in losing,


which as we all know
is completely ridiculous.


But there is however honor
in making a loser feel better,


which is what I just did
for Dwight.


Would I rather be
feared or loved?


Um, easy. Both.


I want people to be afraid
of how much they love me.


And I think I proved that today
at the dojo.


Typewriter torture.


Sensei, help.
Typewriter torture.


No.
Typewriter.


As a boss, I'm always
telling my employees,


"No pain, no gain."


And if that's true,


Dwight gained
an awful lot today.


A lot.


He gained a lesson.


Don't mess with me.


He gained knowledge.


See what happens
when you mess with me?


And he gained pain.


Which is what happens
when you mess with me.


- Hello.


Pammy want a cracker?
bawks like chicken


- No, thanks.
You got a package.


- Ooh, Pam with the dirty talk.
laughs


- And he's lining it up.


Seems pretty straightforward
from here.


whispering
If Michael Scott sinks it,


he'll win a Buick
signed by Tiger Woods.


- Oh!
- Oh, he totally misses.


- whispering
No, he meant to put it


right next to the hole.
That's much harder to do.


- gasps Ah, interception!


He shoots, he scores. Yeah!


Michael, try it like this.


This'll be much harder.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.


I don't want to chip my mug.


Please get that off the floor.


All right, Jack Nicholson
for Bud A.


- whispers
Jack Niklaus.


- It's a celebrity tournament.


Mm.
- I got it.


clears throat No problem.


- You see it?
- Oh, man.


It's really back there.


Yeah.
- Do you feel it?


- I can barely--


ceramic shatters
- Gah, damn it, Dwight.


That's great.


- Should I clean out my desk?


- That won't be necessary.


upbeat piano music





- Most of that is good.


- Not today, Kevin.


I cannot be around carbs today.


You know what one loaf of bread


would do to my abs?


- I'm almost there,


so we should have
plenty of time


to go over the presentation.
- Mm-hmm.


- And, uh,
clears throat excuse me.


I've also confirmed
the meeting


this afternoon at 4:00 pm.


- Conflict.


- What?
- I have a conflict with that.


- What do you mean?
- Uh, pajama party.


At the Playboy Mansion.
With the bunnies.


- Michael...


I need you
to take this seriously--


- I can't get out of it.


- Michael.
- Okay, all right.


- Are you hearing me?
- I'm hearing you.


Meeting confirmed.
- This is very important.


- Meeting confirmed.


Would you like
your confirmation number?


Please grab a pen


because I will only be
repeating this once.


- I'll see you in ten minutes.


- 4-2-8-9-7--okay.


laughs


What is a closer?


A closer is a sales term


for someone
who always gets the job done.


And that is me.


A-B-C.


Always be closing.
"Glengarry Glen Ross."


Hey, gimme the Glen Ross leads.


"No way,
they're just for closers."


Do you know
who you're talking to?


I'm Michael Scott.


"Really?
Well, take any lead you want."


No thanks, I don't need 'em.


Because I have a client list


right here in my computer.


exhales


So, suck on that.


- Hey.


- Hi.


- What are you doing?


- I don't know.


I think I was just
staring at my desk.


- Really?


Do you want
to get back to that?


I could go. I should go.


- Yeah, do you mind leaving?
- Not at all.


- It's very important.
- Mm-hmm.


I'm sorry to interrupt.


- Hey, have they left
for the big meeting yet?


I got Michael's lucky tie.


- No, they're in
the conference room.


- Okay.
- Wait.


Are those Michael's Levi's?


- Yeah.
Who dry-cleans jeans?


- Michael and his jeans.


He gets in them and


I'm not exactly sure
what happens,


but I can tell you,


he loves the way he looks


in those jeans.


I know that's why
he started casual Fridays.


I'll take those.


Thanks.


- This is a projection
of the county's needs.


- Wow, graphs and charts.


Somebody's really
been doing their homework.


Looks like "USA Today."


- 13 schools, 2 hospitals.


- So, this possible client
they're talking about.


Actually, a big deal.


It's Lackawanna County.


Our whole county.


And if we get this,


they might not have
to downsize our branch.


And I could work here
for years.


And years and...years.


- So, when we get to
the Radisson,


I'd like to--
- Oh, I changed it to Chili's.


- Excuse me?


- Radisson just gives out
this vibe.


It's like, "Oh, I'm doing
business at the Radisson."


It's kinda snooty, so...


- You had no right
to do that, Michael.


- Here's the thing,
Chili's is the new golf course.


It's where business happens.


"Small Businessman Magazine."


- It said that.


- It will. I sent it in.


Letter to the editor.


- All right.


But you will let me
run this meeting.


- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.


Power trip.
- What?


- What is it like to close
a really big sale?


Think of the best orgasm
you ever had in your life.


And divide it in half.


It's that good.


- She had done
a background check on me.


She had it printed out.
- No.


- Yeah, and she was
asking me about stuff


line by line
while we were having dinner.


- That is unbelievable.
- What's going on?


- We are doing
worst first dates.


- Oh, my God, I win.


Okay, it was a minor league
hockey game.


He brought his brother.


And when I went
to the bathroom,


the game ended,
and they forgot about me.


- Okay, that's a joke.


- No, they had
to come back for me.


- Wait, when was this?


- Um...


it was not that long ago.


- Wait, not Roy.


Say it's not your fiancé.
laughing


- I always knew Pam
has refused to go


to sports games with Roy.


But I never knew why.


Interesting.


- Oh, that is messed up.
- laughs


- Ha, ha.


Who's next?
- Pam, that's awful.


- What was my worst first date?


Um...


it was a couple years ago.


It was a lunch date.


Actually, it was
right down here at Cugino's.


And we had just met


and we really hit it off.
It was...


kinda nice. Um...


and, uh, then,
as it turned out,


it wasn't even a date
because...


she was actually in love
with someone else.


So...best first date's
also my worst first date,


oddly enough. chuckles


- Okay, let's do this thing.


Wish us luck.


- Good luck, Michael.
Good luck, Jan.


- Thank you.
- quietly Kiss ass.


Okay...probably going
to go late tonight.


Burning the midnight tequila.


So, I think you all
could just take off now.


- Michael, this shouldn't
take more than an hour.


- Well...
- Do you always shut down


the entire office
when you leave for an hour?


- No, no, that would not
be efficient.


Actually, they just don't
get very much work done


when I'm not here.


That's not true.


I know how to delegate.


And they do more work
when I'm not here.


Not more.


The same amount of work is done


whether I am here or not.


Hey, everybody, listen up!


This is what we're gonna do.


You sit tight until I return.


Sound good?


Doesn't matter.


It's an order.


Follow it blindly. Mm-ha-ha!


Okay?


All right, ciao.


Adios!


- So, which way is Chili's?


- Ah, I'll drive.


- No, that's all right.
I wanna leave


straight from there.
- It is just


a couple blocks away, so--


boy, you really don't know
Scranton, do you?


- I know Scranton.
- At all.


Have you ever been
to Scranton, Jen?


- If it's a couple blocks away,


we can go together.
- Dur-de-dur-de-dur. Okay.


Jan Levinson-Gould.


Jan is cold.


If she was sitting
across from you on a train,


and she wasn't moving,
you might think she was dead.


And I want to be the guy
sitting across from her


who reaches out and just
punches her in the chest


and gets her heart going again.


sighs loudly


Remember in high school,


driving around in a convertible


was like the coolest thing
you could do.


Remember?
- I'm feeling so good


I can't even take it


- What high school
did you go to?


Catholic girls' school?


- Uh...


- You keep reading that,
you're gonna get carsick.


Oh, you know what? Reminds me.


We should come up with
a signal of some sort.


- Why would we need a signal?


- Well, in case one of us
gets into trouble,


the other one can signal--


- What kind of trouble
are you planning on


getting in, Michael?


- Well, it could be
either of us.


- You're gonna let me
do the talking,


we agreed on that.


- Yes.


radio playing loudly
- Feeling so good


I can't even take it
- It's too loud, Michael.


- What?
- It's too loud!


- I can't hear you
over the music.


Oh, right, we're almost there.


- And my body's
burning up so hot


Nobody has to be
something they're not


- Do you think
they'll get the account?


How come you never answer me?


- I'm sorry, Phyllis.


No, I don't think
they'll get the account.


- Hello? Christian?
- Yes.


- Thought that was you. Hi.


- Hi.
- Michael Scott.


This is Jan Levinson-Gould.


- Just Jan Levinson.


- No Gould?
- No.


Thank you very much
for meeting with us.


Have you been waiting long?


- No, not long.
- Good, good.


- Uh, Jan, what happened?


- Michael.
- Is Gould dead?


What, uh...
- Michael.


We got divorced, okay?


I'm so sorry, excuse me.
- Wow, you're kidding me.


Do you wanna talk about it?
- Michael.


Could we have
a table for three please?


- When did this happen?


- We're in a meeting.
- Okay.


- This way, please.


- All right, after you.
- Thank you.


- I thought we could start


by going over
the needs of the county.


- Right.


Well, Lackawanna County
has not been immune


to the slow economic growth
over the past five years.


So for us, the name of the game


is budget reduction.
- Awesome Blossom?


- What?


- I think we should share
an Awesome Blossom.


What do you say?
They are awesome.


You want to, Christian?
Awesome?


- Sure, sure.
- Okay, it's done.


Actually, Megan?


May we have an Awesome Blossom,
please?


Extra awesome?


Now it is done.


- So, if you have--
- Hey, I heard a


very, very funny joke


the other day.
You wanna hear it?


- Christian, you don't--


you don't have
to listen to this.


- It's okay.
I like jokes.


- Okay.


- Just the one.


- Just one joke? Okay.


Well, if it's just
gonna be one...


I will think of
a different joke.


Um...


- Dunder Miflin,
this is Pam.


- Pam, it's Michael.
I need you to go


into my office
and check some data for me.


- Okay.


Um, you want me to read 'em?


- Yes.
- Okay.


Um, a fisherman
is walking down 5th Avenue


leading an animal behind him.
- Nope!


Nope, told it.
Not as good as you think.


Pick another one.
- Okay.


There's a transcript
between a Naval ship--


- Oh, hey! Bingo.


And a lighthouse.


Yes, that is hysterical.


Could you start that one
from the beginning?


- Sure. There's a transcript


between a naval ship
and a lighthouse.


- Is this real?


- It is a screenplay.


Starring himself.


- Agent Michael Scarn.


- Of the FBI.


- How long is this?


Oh, Pam, good work.


Oh, wait, stop.


Drawings.
- What is that?


- Oh, those are drawings,


in case the writing
didn't really


put a picture in your head.


And there he is, in the flesh,


Agent Michael Scarn.


Now we know what he looks like.


- First guy says,
"Well, I'm an astronaut,


so I drive a Saturn."


And the second guy says,
"Well, I am a pimp,


so I drive a cheap Escort."


And the third guy says,
"I got you both beat.


"I'm a proctologist


so I drive a brown Probe."


- laughing Oh, no!


Oh, my God, that's funny!


I almost had Awesome Blossom
coming out of my nose!


laughing


- Excuse me, could I have
a vodka tonic, please?


- Oh, drinks.


both chanting
Drinks, drinks, drinks, drinks.


- Vodka tonic.
both: Drinks, drinks, drinks.


- No, you know what?
Cancel that.


Uh, I hear...
makes whooshing noise


an El Niño coming in.


El Niños for everyone.


- Oh, no, no, no.
- Yes, mm-hmm.


Mm-hmm.
- I love El Niño margaritas.


both laugh


Yes!


Oh.
- Oh.


- Awesome!
- Isn't it?


- Mm!
- That dipping sauce.


- Do we all have our copy of


"Threat Level Midnight"
by Michael Scott?


all murmuring assent


All right,
let's get this started.


I'm gonna be reading
the action descriptions.


And Phyllis, I would
like you to play


Catherine Zeta-Jones.


- That's the character's name?


- You guys should
not be doing this.


- Why not, Dwight?
This is a movie.


I mean, this is


for all of America to enjoy.


- You took something


that doesn't belong to you.
- Dwight.


- Brought it in here,


made copies of it--
- Do you want


to play the lead role


of Agent Michael Scarn?


- Argh! munching noises


That's delicious!
- laughing


- I love it.


- Can we--can we, uh...


could we talk about
your account, please?


- Okay, downer.


chuckles


- Are you upset, Jan?


- No! I'm--no, I'm not.


I'm not upset.
- I mean, it's okay.


I know what it's like.


You know,
my parents were divorced.


- Oh, really?
- It was tough at first


but then I sort of liked it,
you know?


I had two rooms.


My dad's place was like a fort


and my mom's place
was home base.


- Did you have bunk beds?


- No. No, I didn't.
- Ah.


sighs
- That's too bad.


- I wish I'd had bunk beds.


- I'd get 'em now.


- Yes, that's too bad.


Okay, we would probably
be upset with ourselves


if we went this whole night
without talking business.


So, Dunder Miflin can provide


a level of personal service
to the county


that suppliers like Staples
can't match.


- Well, we are out
to save money.


- What's the bottom line?
- Blah!


Blah, blah, blah.
speaking nonsense


That's why I wanted
a signal between us.


So, I wouldn't have to
just shout nonsense words.


That's her fault.


Did somebody say


baby back ribs?


Hmm? Hmm?


- I don't think Christian


has time for that, Michael.
- I have time.


- I want my baby back,
baby back, baby back


both: I want my baby back,
baby back, baby back


I want my baby back
baby back baby back


- Chili's baby back ribs


- Location, a bank.


A man, very good looking,


runs into a bank
and kills a bank robber.


- I am Michael Scarn
with the FBI.


Freeze.


- Who's he saying "freeze" to


if the bank robber's dead?


- I don't know.


Inside the FBI,
Agent Michael Scarn


sits with his feet
up on his desk.


Catherine Zeta-Jones enters.


- Um, sir, you have
some messages.


- Not now!
- They're important.


- Okay, what are they?


- The first message is:


I love you.


That's from me.


- Not in a thousand years,
Catherine.


We work together.


And get off my desk.


Yes, I have acted before.


I was in a production
of "Oklahoma!"


in the seventh grade.


I played the part
of Mutey the Mailman.


They had too many kids,


so they made up roles
like that.


I was good.


Let's maintain this--


what are you--where you going?


- Home. It's after 5:00.


- Yeah, but Michael said


for us to stay
until he got back.


- Okay.


- What is--


when he comes back,


he's gonna see you're not here.


- Okay.


- Okay...


don't let it affect
your performance.


Here we go. Phyllis.


- The President called.


- Business or social?


- Both.
He has an assignment for you.


Very dangerous, maybe deadly


and he wants you to be


the best man at his wedding.


- Put him through.
But I'm only


gonna talk business.


- Hey, Michael.


How's it hanging?


- It's hanging pretty good,
Mr. President.


I understand you have
a dangerous assignment


and I'm your man.


- I do.


I have a dangerous assignment.


Are you my man?


- You heard me the first time,
you joker.


- That would be pretty cool


if Michael starred in a movie


with Catherine Zeta-Jones.


She is so hot.


all singing to tune of
"Happy Birthday"


Happy retirement to you


Happy retirement to you
- Stop!


Everyone, I'm not retiring.


- Everyone stops singing


'cause he's not retiring.


- Well, if it isn't
my old partner,


Samuel L. Chang.


- Agent Michael Scarn,


you lost some weight.


- Thank you for noticing.


Now, keep me company
for one more mission.


- whispering
Hey, I have to work late.


- As soon as I blow out
these candles,


I'm retired.
- You're joking, right?


- Michael Scarn takes out
a nine millimeter gun


and shoots the cake to bits.
- making gun noises


- Ha, ha, ha.


Agent Michael Scarn,
you so funny.


Word.


- Michael's movie?


Two thumbs down.


loud sucking noises


- I bet 100.
- Sir,


the minimum bet is 1,000.


- If you had let me
finish my sentence,


you would have heard me say,


"I bet 100,000."


Sam, get me my money bag.


- Ha, ha, ha, ha.


Agent Michael Scarn,
you so funny.


You da bomb.


- Mm, yeah.


It kinda seems like


all the movies that I like.


- A man sitting
several seats down


who has a gold face
turns to Michael Scarn.


Uh, ooh.


Oscar, you wanna play
Goldenface?


- clears throat


Mr. Scarn,


perhaps you would be
comfortable


in my private jet.


- Yes, perhaps I would,
Goldenface.


Sam, get my luggage.


- I forget it, brotha.


- Samuel, you are such
an idiot!


You are the worst
assistant ever.


And you're disgusting, Dwigt.


Wait, who's "Dwigt"?


- Here's what
we think happened.


Michael's sidekick,


who all through the movie
is this complete idiot


who's causing the downfall
of the United States,


was originally named Dwight.


But then Michael changed it


to Samuel L. Chang


using a search and replace.


But that doesn't work
on misspelled words.


Leaving behind one Dwigt.


And Dwight figured it out.


Oops.


- D-W-I-G-H-T.


Okay, you know what?


I am done with this.


That's it, the end.


- Well, some of us
wanna keep reading--


- Uh, you don't speak
for everyone, Jim.


Okay, announcement.


My uncle bought me
some fireworks.


And anyone who wants
to see a real show,


come with me outside now.


- That's actually a good idea.


We'll all take
a brief intermission.


Hey, are you hungry?


- Yeah.
- Yeah?


- And so after watching my mom
go through so much pain,


I decided to keep that promise


that I made to her.


And take care of her.


- Hoo.


Well, this brings us to Jan.


Truth or dare.
Tell us about your divorce.


- Oh, no, Michael.
Michael, Michael.


- Do, do.
- Michael, Michael, please.


No, really.
- Oh, hey.


So, you're not gonna play.
She's not playing.


- That's not fair.
- She's not playing the game.


- We'd been fighting
for a while.


He didn't want kids.
I knew that going into it.


But he also knew that I did.


So, I guess I thought that
he would change his mind.


He thought that
I would change mine.


- You didn't.


- I was stupid.


- No, no, you were not stupid.


Gould was stupid, right?
- That's right.


- You know?
- You were really brave.


I mean, you put
your arms out there.


You slit your wrist.
- That's true.


- You said,
"World, this is my blood.


"It's red, just like yours.


So, love me."


- I had plans to meet
a friend tonight.


Which I had to cancel.


But this is cool, too.


I'm not a complainer.


Wow.


- For the bugs.


- Nice.


That's excellent
because bugs love


my famous grilled cheese
sandwich.


- Yes!


Nice.


Okay, what's in here?


- Uh, sliced tomato.


Uh, we happened to have
one around, actually.


I just had to wash off
the name "Angela"?


- I guess that's
a tomato company.


- I guess you're right.


- I can't remember
the last time


someone made me dinner.


- Whoa!


Yeah, whoo! Whoo!


whooping and hollering


Whoo-hoo!


- Right down the street?
- Mm-hmm.


Kenneth Road, born and raised.


Spent my whole life


right here
in Lackawanna County.


And I do not intend on moving.


I know this place.


I know how many
hospitals we have.


I know how many
schools we have.


It's home, you know?


I know the challenges that
this county's up against.


Here's the thing about
those discount suppliers,


they don't care.


They come in,
they undercut everything.


And they run us
out of business.


And then, once we're all gone,


they jack up the prices.
- I know.


- It's bad.
- It's terrible.


- It is--you know what?
It really is.


- Uh--


- I don't know.


I guess I could give you guys
our business,


but you have
to meet me halfway, okay?


Because they're expecting me
to make cuts.


- Well,


corporate's gonna
go ballistic, but


you think we could, Jan?


- Bullets are flying
everywhere.


Ooh, wait, last page.


Big finish, here we go.


Agent Scarn kicks open the
plane door with a karate chop.


- A kick and a chop are two
totally different things.


- Well, it's just
a movie, Dwigt.


- It doesn't make any sense.


- Yeah, now it doesn't
make any sense.


- Don't jump, Agent Scarn.
There are no parachutes.


- Just then, Agent Chang
gets a bullet in the head.


- Oh, so close to retirement.


- Another bullet heads towards
Agent Michael Scarn


but he jumps out of the plane


without a parachute.


- Is that it?


- Yup, I guess so.


- Does he die?


- I sincerely doubt it.


- I have to say,


I think this is
a terrible movie.


- So, I guess
I'll see you


in...ten hours.


- What are you gonna do
with your time off?


- Travel.
- Yeah.


- I've been
looking forward to it.


It's gonna be...


really nice.


I'm gonna find myself.


- You have new music?


- Yeah.


Definitely.


soft rock music playing





- See ya.
- Bye.


Thanks.


Yes!
- We did it.


- We got it!
- Nailed it.


- I mean, we got it!
- Nailed it!


Come here.
- Oh!


- grunts playfully
- laughs


- I am really...thrilled.


Let's go.
- What?


Let's go. Go and--okay.


Where are we going?


Doesn't matter.


Goin' to the go-go.


Okay.


- Michael?


Michael?


Michael?


His car's not
in the parking lot.


I should check
the accident reports.


Who's this?


Jan?


car beeps


- My craft group
thinks I'm negative.


I'm gonna try to be
a better person.


Someone took my tomato.


Morning, Pam.


- Michael loves
his entrance lines.


He always has one.


It's usually, like,


some version of my name,


like a pun, but not really.


And today, nothing.


It was really odd.


- Made the sale last night.


- All right.
clapping


- How'd everything go here?


- Good.
- Good.


No, nothing happened.


I swear!


Nothing happened.


What--I'm


totally being serious.


A gentleman does not
kiss and tell.


And neither do I.


laughs I'm--


No, seriously, guys, I'm not--


I don't wanna
go into it at all.


It's off limits.


Fine, I took her back
to her hotel,


and we made out


for a little while.
It was great.


I mean, she told me
about her divorce.


We talked for about five hours.


She fell asleep on my arm.


Hello, Dwight.


- Did you do her?


- Who?
- Jan Levinson-Gould.


- Uh, no, no.


No Gould.


- Did you do her?
- This is none of your affair.


Because she is your boss.
- And she is your boss.


- And she is a woman.


She is a strong,
soft, thoughtful,


sexy woman.


And you know what?
I don't think I can sit here


and let you talk about her


that way without me


defending her honor.


Jan, I defend your honor.


Is that all?


- Jan didn't come back
for her car last night.


- What?


- Could it be
that Agent Michael Scarn


has finally found
his Catherine Zeta?


- Oh, I don't know...


phone rings


Oh, my God.


This is Jan's cell.


- No way.


- Dunder Miflin,
this is Pam.


- I know we have to register


as a consensual
sexual relationship with HR.


My question,
do I do it as the man,


does she do it as my superior?


I don't know.
That leads to other issues


that we may have


in our relationship.
It's, uh...


phone ringing
Excuse me.


Hello?


Hi. Just talking about you.


The camera, no.


Uh-huh.


How's traffic?


I miss you. What?


Okay.


Well...


if it was a mistake,
it was a wonderful mistake.


No.


Just...


No, I did not intentionally
get you drunk.


Mm-hmm.


No, no.


This is just a fight.


This is just a first fight


of many fights
we're gonna have.


Right.


No.


You--I don't understand.


You wanna see other people.


Only other people.


Wha--okay.


I think you're still
a little bit drunk.


Excuse me. Excuse me?


I think you're st--yes.


Why don't you
just come back here?


We can go to the hotel.


Have a few drinks.


No, I didn't
slip you something!


- Some might even say we had


our first date last night.


- Oh, really?
- Really.


- Why might some say that?


- 'Cause there was dinner.


By candlelight.
- Mm-hmm.


- Dinner and a show
if you include Michael's movie.


And there was


dancing and fireworks.


Pretty good date.
- We didn't dance.


- You're right,
we didn't dance.


It was more like...swaying.


But still romantic.


Swaying isn't dancing.


- At least I didn't leave you


at a high school hockey game.


- I have some faxes
to get out.


- Oh, come on, Pam, I--


Okay, we didn't dance.


And I was totally joking,
anyway.


I mean, it's not really a date


if the girl goes home
to her fiancé.


Right?


- Did I? Yeah.
I closed a huge account once.


Xerox.


Hundreds of millions
of dollars.


There was some
confusion though.


They thought
they were selling to me


and I thought
I was selling to them.


But, wow, still.


That was a night.


breathing rhythmically


You should get
one of these.


No.
Thank you.


Do you even know
what this is?


It is a fitness orb,


and it has completely
changed my life.


sighs


Forget everything you thought
you knew about ab workouts.


Done.


This ab workout


is specifically designed
to strengthen your core.


Sorry.


All right.


Numerous health benefits.


breathing rhythmically


Strengthens your back.

Better performance in sports.

More enjoyable sex.


You're not having sex.

your reflexes.


See, I would've
caught that.


Okay, you know what,
uh, how much is that?


It's only 25 bucks.
Wow.


Um, okay.


soft piano music





upbeat music





Oscar, I'm ready for you.


(Oscar)
Today is performance
review day company-wide,


and I'm a little concerned
about my review.


I exceeded my sick days
and my personal days


because I just
couldn't take it.


(Oscar)
And I don't have a good answer
for him when he asks me.


inhales deeply


So.


Michael, I don't know
what to say.


Um, you're in accounting.


Yes.
I'm in accounting.


And I'm sorry about
all the extra days.


I know I'm past my limit.


So good, good, good.
Something to work toward.


Being here more.


I'm a big believer in people
being here more.


Yes.


paper rips


tape rips


paper rustling


Do you know what this is?
Yes.


No, you don't.
Then why the question?


This is a visual aid
for my performance review.


Budget is tight and
if anyone is getting a raise,


it is gonna be a fight
to the death,


and I intend on winning
that fight.


Dwight.


Determined.


Worker.


Intense.


Good worker.


Hard worker.


Terrific.


Dwight.


I have one, too.


marker scribbling


Jim.


Uh, Jim.


Is Jim.


My name is Jim.


sighs


It's a total waste of your M.


Really?
Yeah.


You have a better idea?


Yeah.
Magnificent worker.


Marvelous worker.
More money for this worker.


Man, I like this worker.


Mighty worker.


That's good.
Oof, that's good.


I'll use that.


Pam, could I see you
in my office?


(Pam)
It's performance review day
company-wide.


Last year,
my performance review started


with Michael asking me
what my hopes and dreams were,


and it ended with him
telling me


he could bench-press
pounds.


So I don't really know
what to expect.


Pam,
you're trustworthy.


Thank you.


And a woman.
Oh, no.


And I want you to listen
to a voice mail from my boss.


Jan on answering machine
Michael, it's Jan.


I guess I missed you.


I'll, uh, be there
this afternoon


for performance reviews.


I hope it's understood


that that will be
our only topic of discussion.


See you soon.


First impressions?


Uh, just off the top,


I think she'll be here
this afternoon.


(Michael)
My boss is coming in today.


The lovely
Jan Levinson-Gould.


W-well, no Gould.


The Gould has been
chop noise divorce.


Um, the awkward part


is that this
is the first time


we'll be seeing each other
since...


well.


Uh, it was really nothing.


We just sort of got caught up
in the moment.


The vulnerable divorcée
gives herself


to the understanding
with rugged good looks


office manager.


Just, uh,


she didn't want it to continue
for some reason.


We both didn't--
I didn't want--


we both didn't want it
to continue.


It was not professional.


Um, when people say
something's mutual,


it never is.


But this was mutual.


(Pam)
I guess I missed you.


I guess I missed you.


So she misses me.


She missed you.


But then, she goes on to say,


"That will be our only topic
of discussion."


That doesn't mean anything.
Those are just words.


I have one idea
of what it means.


Okay. Yeah. What? What?


Well, I don't think
you're going to be


very happy with this.
Oh, great.


All right, well,
now I'm in a terrible mood.


pen clicks
inhales deeply


Let's do
your performance review.


Because she's conflicted.


She has to be
professional,


but she's fighting
feelings for you.


Ah. Why--
that's great news.


That--that--
then why would--


why would I not
like that?


Um, just cause
that you work together,


and it might be awkward.
Wow, wow.


All right, let's listen
to that again.


(Pam)
Michael, it's Jan.


I guess I missed you.


Oh, hey.


Listen, Jim.


Here's a little tip
for your performance review.


Okay.


Tell Michael that we
should be stocking more


of the double-tabbed
manilla file folders.


We don't have double-tabbed
manilla files folders.


Oh, yes we do.
No, we don't.


Yeah, it's a new product.


So you should just
suggest that to him,


and then he'll be sure
to give you a raise.


Uh-huh.


We'll, I'm not asking
for a raise.


I'm gonna actually be asking
for a pay decrease.


Uh, that is so stupid.


What if he gives it
to you?


I win.
Ugh.


You know what,


I am going to zone you out
for the rest of today, okay?


I need to stay focused.


And I don't have to see you
tomorrow or Sunday.


And please don't call me,


and we'll see how things go
on Monday.


sighs
Stupid.


Wait, wait. One thing.


Um, by tomorrow,
you mean Saturday, right?


Uh, duh.


Duh.


Today is Thursday.


But Dwight thinks
that it's Friday.


And that's what
I'll be working on


this afternoon.


Sometimes women say more
in their pauses


than they say
in their words.


Really.
Oh, yes.


Let's listen to it again.


And this time,
really listen to the pauses.


God, Stanley,
that's freakin' brilliant.


How do you know that?


Did you learn that
on the streets?


Sorry.
Oh, it's okay.


I did learn it on the streets.


On the ghetto, in fact.


No kidding.


It's all about my bonus.


Michael and Jan
definitely made out.
Oh.


Maybe more.
Ugh.


Oh, also, it is Thursday,


but Dwight thinks
it's Friday,


so keep that going.


Oh, yay.


Good work, Stanley.


Great performance review.


Stanley in the house,
everybody.


Whoo!


Angela, your turn.


(Angela)
I actually look forward
to performance reviews.


I did the youth
beauty pageant circuit,


and I enjoyed that
quite a bit.


I really enjoy being judged.


I believe I hold up very well
to even severe scrutiny.


Michael.
Yeah.


Jan's on the phone
for you.


Oh. Angela, you were totally
satisfactory this year.


door slams


Interesting.
Jan is calling me.


Maybe it wasn't
so mutual after all.


Yeah.


Jan on speakerphone
Michael.


Jan, to what do I owe
this pleasure?


I am returning
your many calls.


Well, hello to you, too.


Um, yeah, I was just, um,


I just wanted to get
some closure


on what transpired
between us at the meeting


we had in the parking lot
of the Chili's.


No.


No, we--we won't
be discussing that, Michael.


The only things
I want to talk about


during your performance
review


are your concrete ideas
to improve your branch.


Well, surely this, uh,
review is a formality


because of what happened, uh,


at our meeting in the
parking lot of the Chili's.


Review is anything but
a formality, Michael.


And, uh, I expect you
to forget anything


that you think may have
happened between us


and exhibit completely
professional behavior.


Been thinking about you.


Okay, that is an example


of completely unprofessional
behavior.


Mm, I don't see
how that's unprofessional.


Michael.


Yeah?


Are the cameras in there
with you in your office?


No, they are not.


Yes, they are.


sighs


phone hangs up


dial tone droning


That's my girlfriend.


I heard they made out
and had sex.


whispering
I heard they just made out.


That's it.


Well, I heard
they made out...


and had sex.


Don't talk about it.


Office romances
are nobody's business


but the people involved.


Romances?


Pam, I have ideas
on a daily basis.


I know I do.


I have a clear memory
of telling people my ideas.


Um, is there any chance


that you wrote
any of my ideas down,


like, in a folder?


Like, a idea folder?


Sorry.


That's unfortunate.
inhales deeply


whispers
How about the suggestion box?


There's tons of ideas
in there.


What suggestion box?


The suggestion box
that I put out,


and people could put in
suggestions anonymously.


Maybe there's prizes.


Oh, yeah.


Uh, I think I remember that
from back when I first started.


Why don't you find it


and then tell people
to get theirs?


Never mind. I'll tell them.
Hello, everybody.


Yeah.
Uh, attention, please.


Jan Levinson's coming


very soon.


And so we're going
to have


our weekly suggestion box
meeting.


So you can all get in
your constructive compliments


ASAP.


Don't you mean
constructive criticism?


What did I say?


You said constructive
compliments.


That doesn't make
any sense.


Well, Kelly,


that was neither constructive
nor a compliment,


so maybe you should stop
criticizing my English


and start making
some suggestions.


Okay?


Hey, Dan,
this is Jim.


It is about 11:15
and I wanted to know


what you were
up to tomorrow,


which is the 15th
and that is a...


Saturday.
Saturday.


So just let me know
what you're doing tomorrow,


Saturday, for lunch.


Okay, talk to you soon.


So that's...
Uh-huh.


That's great.
Yes, it is.


Yeah. You have fun?
Yes, I did.


Did you...go to first base?


Hell, yeah.
Oh, yeah?


Yeah.


Did you go to second?


What?
Second?


Kind of, yeah.


Over the shirt.


My elbow, but.


Okay. So close call on second.


Um...
exhales deeply


Was there an infield fly?


Um, yep.


Wait. Yes.


Pop-up?


No.


There--later, there was.


Really?
Yes.


So you got the signal
from the third base coach?


chuckles


You know what I'm saying, like,
if there was a, you know,


a fly out to deep right.


Mm-hmm.
You know?


A runner on second?
You tagged up, didn't he?


I didn't--you know, it was--


It was dark, for one thing.


Jan talking on phone


Okay.


Okay, bye-bye.
flip phone clicks


Would you please tell Michael
that I'm here?


(Pam)
Sure.


Hi, Jan.
How are you?


Hi, Michael.
I'm good. How are you?


Good to see you.
Nice to see you.


Okay.


Okay, why don't we
just step into my off--


chuckles


We're going to go
in here.


Can we please go
into your office?


Yep.
Right after you.


Après vous.


exhales deeply


Oh, thank you.


It's nice
to see you.


Nice to see you too,
Michael.


Really?


Not like that.


Oh, well...


You know, Michael,
I think I need to make


something clear
right off the top.


I'm not going to discuss
anything with you


other than Dunder Mifflin
business.


All right.
Period.


Yup.


Do we understand
each other?
Absolutely.


I'm a little confused


because first it's, like,
all kissy-kissy.


And then it's, like,
all regret.


Because, "Oh, I regret that.


"But wait,
I'm still going to call you.


"But--but we're just
going to talk business.


"And I may come down there
and fire you


if you don't do your job."


But what were we talking about
when we first kissed?


Business.


So are you still
in the middle


of the performance
reviews then?


No, no, no.
I finished all of that.


I'm very fast.


I'm not too fast.


Not like wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am.


But I do say thank you,
ma'am.


But I'm not like, wham, bam.


Not that there's anything
wrong with wham, bam.


If it's consensual.


We're talking
about office stuff.


Can I ask you a question?
No.


This is a business question.


It's nothing personal.
I promise.


Fine.


Are you wearing
new perfume today?


How is that
a business question?


Well, you're wearing it
at the office.


And... sniffs
It...


I'm sorry, no offense,
but it's really sexy.


Please don't smell me,
Michael.


Hey, Jim.
Hey, how's it going?


Oh, my God.


Did you seed The Apprentice
last night?


Of course.
It's on every Thursday night.


So how can I miss it?


Can you believe
who Trump fired?


No.
That was unbelievable.


Who? Who was it?


Who did he fire?


You didn't see it?
No.


I went out and got drunk


with my laser tag team
last night.


Crap.


I never go out
on a Thursday night.


What the hell
was I thinking?


I don't understand--


phone rings


Hold on. Sorry.


Yes, Pam.


(Pam)
Michael, it's time for the
suggestion box meeting.


I'm kind of in the middle
of something.


I wish you wouldn't
interrupt.


You told me to buzz you


about the suggestion box
meeting


when Jan was here.


I did not--not--not use
those words.


Uh, I'd like to sit in
on that meeting.


Is it happening right now?


No, it's in,
like, 10 minutes.


Everyone's waiting
in the conference room.


sighs
Great. Very good.


What is this meeting for,
again?


(Dwight)
Do you want me to handle this?


No, I do not.


Why are we here, Oscar?


Because I value
your opinions.


And know a lot of you
don't think


that I read
your suggestions,


but I do.


Every week, I comb through
everything that you have to say


and I value your comments.


I just thought it would be nice


to do this together
for a change.


You read our suggestions
every week?


More or less, yeah. I do.


So let's take a look
at these suckers, shall we?


Oh, uh, question.
Do you want me to read them?


No, I'll read them.
Okay.


Can I take them out of the box?
I can take them out.


I'll take them out.


Can I hold the box?
I'll hold the box.


Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Why don't you hold the box?


You wanna hold the box?
Please.


You happy?
You finally happy?


You gonna tell your stupid,
Amish cousin that you live with


that you got to hold
a box today,


you freakin' monster?


takes deep breath


Let's read 'em.


All right.


Number one,
what should we do


to prepare for Y2K?


What should we do
to prepare for Y2K?


I thought you read these
every week.


Well, obviously,
this one got stuck in the box.


That happens occasionally.


(Dwight)
It happens occasionally.


And, um, so one down.


Next suggestion.


"We need better outreach


for employees
fighting depression."


Okay, all right.
Enough with the jokes.


Nobody in here
is suffering from depression.


That sounds serious,
Michael.


Oh. Okay. Well, yeah?


Who wrote it?
Tom.


Tom. Then it is a joke


because there is nobody
in here named Tom.


(Phyllis)
Tom?


He worked in accounting up
until about a year ago.


whispers
Tom.


imitates gunshot


Oh, that guy?
That guy was weird.


All right, next suggestion.


Next suggestion.


Ar, badoo badoo.


You need to do something
about your B.O.


You need to do something
about your B.O.


Okay, now I don't know who this
suggestion is meant for,


but it's more
of a personal suggestion.


And it's not an office
suggestion.


Far be it from me
to use this as a platform


to embarrass anybody.


Aren't the suggestions
meant for you?


Well, Toby,


if by me you are inferring
that I have B.O.,


then I would say that that
is a very poor choice of words.


Uh, Michael,


he wasn't inferring,
he was implying.


You were inferring.


Was I, Creed?


Okay, well, you know what?


I am implying is that when
we're on an elevator together,


I should maybe
take the stairs


because talk about stank.


Not that I would ever


say something like that
in public


and I never have
and I never will,


I just think it's something


that we should all be aware of.


Okay?
scoffs


Now that
we've learned this,


let's continue.


See, this is good.


We're learning,


and we're figuring
some stuff out.


You need to do something
about your coffee breath.


You need to do
something about--
Okay, no.


Shut up, shut up.
shut up, Dwight.


Okay, I don't think
you people are grasping


the concept
of the suggestion box.


Sometimes, you talk to us
real close.


Yeah?
Is that hard for you?


All right.
Well, when you have
coffee breath, it's hard.


Let's k--
let's keep going.


Yup.


What do we have here?


We have...


somebody's piece of gum.


Somebody put a piece
of gum in there.


This is not a--a garbage can,


this is the future
of our company.


This is not a place
for gum, okay?


I don't want to have
to read these tomorrow...


Yeah, who wants to come in
on a Saturday?


Yeah. What? No.
Okay.


Let's just--let's just push on,
shall we?


Pushing on.


Just gimme the next two.
Let's just keep it going.


Look on the supply shelf.


What?


What is that?


All right, um, Ryan,


look on the supply shelf,
would you?


Yeah.


It's another note.


Okay.


Look on the windshield.


Okay.


Does it specify
which windshield?


I'll check them all.


sighs


(Dwight)
This ought to be good.


(Stanley)
Which one?


(Dwight)
There it is!


Where?


It's on the black one.
He doesn't see it.


(Stanley)
It's right there.


It's on the Miata!
He sees it.


(Dwight)
Go--okay, he's got it.


What does it say?


Look under the sink
in the men's room!


What I try to do
with these people...
sighs


Is get them to--to be honest


like that whole
coffee breath thing.


That's good, that's good,


You know what?
I drink a lot of coffee.


And it's not saying that I have
bad breath, it's just saying--


Frankly, I think that
this entire meeting


is a bit of a waste of time,
Michael.


Well, we haven't finished yet.


We've now been here 15 minutes.
Right.


We've just been sitting here
doing this.


Come on back, come on back.
These needless suggestions.


(Michael)
Well, we just have
a couple more.


All right, don't break any land
speed records getting back.


Okay, Stanley?
All right.


Next suggestion.
Next suggestion.


Don't--
Okay, that's blank.


Don't--just--


Don't sleep
with your boss.


Do you think
this is referring


to you boning Jan?


Okay, let me--
let me make something clear.


As embarrassing as this is,


I feel that it needs
to be said.


There is nothing romantic
or--or


sexual going on


with Michael and myself.
Well--


The other night, I gave him
a polite, congratulatory kiss


because he just closed
the biggest deal of his--


his career and--and--
and that's it.


Okay?


If anything else has been
inferred or implied,


it's just not true.


So.


Is everyone straight on that?


Crystal.


There's one more suggestion.


Press it.


You can, um--


Way to go, man.
Jan's really hot.


Okay, I think we're good.


I can't--I can't--
I don't understand
why you're so upset.


All right,
please sit down.


I'm going to sit over here.
You're going to sit over there.


Let me ask you this.
Please sit yourself down.


Let me ask you something.
What, Michael?


Where did you get your outfit?
groans


What is an office?


Is it a group of people?
Maybe.


Is it an idea?
Of course, yes.


Is it a living organism?


Exactly. Yes.


And any single-cell organism
has to have a spine,


and that's me.


But the spine is always
controlled by a brain,


and that is Jan.


But the brain needs a heart,
and that is me again.


chuckling
So ironic.


You know what?


The heart is smarter
than the brain.


clock ticking


But the brain is so effin' hot.


Oh, my God.


When Dwight said that no one
wants to come in on Saturday?


Pam.
I almost lost it.


chuckling
That was too good.


Well, that is because that is
the gift that keeps on giving.


(Pam)
laughing quietly


Oh, my God.


I left today's paper
on my desk.


You mean yesterday's paper.


What?


Yes.


That is exactly what I mean.


Whoa.


You are very good
at what you do.


Thank you.


chewing loudly


Hey, temp.
Hey.


Look, we're twins.


Huh. chuckles
Cool.


Bet you I got mine
for less than yours.


I bet you did.


Mm, getting a little something
to calm the nerves?


What nerves?


For the performance review.


Oh, wait. You don't get one.
You're a temp.


Ha-ha.
chuckles politely


Actually, I had mine already.


You're lying.


Why would I lie about
a performance review?


Why would Michael give you one
before me?


I think because


my name is before yours
in alphabetical order.

sighs
How did it go?


Fine. He actually gave me
a small raise,


which I did not ask for.

You're gonna give me

I deserve this raise.





Yes.


Yes! Yes!


Ha!


The least you can do


is keep my salary consistent
with inflation.


Kah-ah!


Yes!


Why are you going to give me
this raise?


Why?


(Motley Crue)
Kneel down, you sinners


Because I'm awesome!


I am awesome!


(Motley Crue)
Wild side


sighs


I just don't understand


why you have to pretend
like nothing happened.


Because nothing did, Michael.


I'm not going to say anything
more about it,


and I would advise
that you do the same.


Look--


Michael.
Oh, my God.


I'm sorry. I'm interrupting?
Oh, God.


Were you guys making out?


No, Dwight. Come in.
Great.


What do you want,
Dwight?


I am ready
for my performance review.


Okay. Great.


Your performance
has been adequate.


You may leave.
Good-bye.


Is this how
you've been conducting


all the reviews, Michael?


You want to talk now?
Good. Okay, Dwight, leave.


Uh, wait. I would like
to discuss my raise.


Why on Earth
would we give you a raise?


That is an excellent
question.


Thank you for asking.


Let me bring up one word.


Dedication.


I have never...


been late.


Also, I have never
missed a day due to illness.


sighs


Even when I had
walking pneumonia.


I even come in on holidays.


You do? How do you get in?


I have a copy of your key.


That's a serious offense.


That is a serious offense.
Very serious.


shakily As is
toying with a man's heart.


Oh, Michael,
for God sakes.


I'd also further like to talk
about my merits


in the workplace.


Okay, third wheel,
why don't you do that?


For instance,


the time I brought in deer
jerky for the whole office.


That was deer? Gross. Oh...


You liked it.
God. Did not.


Jan, have you ever
had deer?


No.
It's a delicacy.


And you know what?
It's an aphrodisiac.


So when we're done here,


you guys could go over
to the Antler Lodge,


sample some deer,
and talk about my raise.


What do you say, Jan?


Okay. Here's what
I'm going to do.


I'm going to step outside,
collect my thoughts,


and I will return
in about 10 minutes.


Okay, you just, uh,
clear your head.


Thank you,
Dwight.


door slams


Look, I know it's your job,


I know you have to ask,
but I promise you,


I'm not going to discuss it
with him.


I'm certainly not
going to discuss it with you.


Do you have a light?


And in conclusion,


I think Lex Luthor
said it best


when he said,
"Dad, you have no idea


what I'm capable of."


That's from Superman?


Smallville.


And that is why I feel
I deserve


this raise.


There's never a good time
to ask for a raise.


You just have to go for it.


Maybe they were making out.


Yeah, that got a little out
of control.


inhales deeply


Jan's taking a break,
which is fine.


I'm doing the same.
Just chillin'.


Get my mind off of us.


She's right, I need to be more
professional at the office.


When I'm at work,
I need to focus on work.


I should call her ex-husband.


Yes, hello.
Is this R. Gould?


Hi.
Uh, my name is Michael Scott.


I work at Dunder-Mifflin
with your wife, Jan--


ex-wife, Jan.


Yeah, that's me.
Um, I had a question.


Uh, I was wondering whether


I could ask something
sort of personal


about your wife--
ex-wife?


Okay.


Or can I ask anyway?


Well, I'm just gonna ask.


When you guys were dating,


was she sort of easy to get
and then sort of hard to get?


Okay.


Yeah, that Gould
is a real interesting guy.


What a gem.


inhales deeply


I can see why he and Jan
are no longer together.


If--if my conversation with him


is any measure
of their relationship,


he was verbally abusive,
he was curt,


he was, uh,


he had an inability
to communicate, shall I say?


He was emotionally unavailable.


I don't--I don't know
how she dealt with that


as long as she did.


(Pam)
Do you think Michael and Jan
actually...


I don't really want
to picture it,


but thank you, Pam.


How do you come back
from that?


Um, you don't, I don't think,


come all the way back,
you know.


Especially
working together.


No, I mean,
doing that with Michael.


How do you come back
from that?


Oh.
As a human being?


Yeah, no.
I don't think you can.


Office romances?
Um...


chuckles


I think you should probably
ask Pam.


'Cause she's in
an office romance.


Technically.


Look under the suggestion box.


I can't believe I kept this up
all day.


Signed, me.


I'm heading back to New York.


Allan and I will conduct
your performance review


over the phone tomorrow, okay?


Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.


No, no. I just--I just want
to know why.


Michael, now is not
the time or the place.


Okay. So you're saying that
there is a different time...
No.


Or place that we can have
this discussion?


I am saying we are never
gonna have this conversation.


Well, okay.


What, never as in
never ever ever?


Or never as in
there's no chance?


(Jan)
Never for me
always means never ever ever.


Well, then,
Gould wasn't kidding.


What?
sighs Nothing.


What did you say, Michael?


I just--exhales deeply
Nothing.


Did you call my ex?


No, I did not.


Gould? You said Gould.


Maybe I did.


Maybe I called him.
I don't know.


How dare you, Michael.


My personal life is off-limits
to you, okay?
I'm--


How dare you do that?


I didn't do that.
I--maybe he called me.


Why would he do that?
Why would he call you, Michael?


Why would my husband call you?
Ex-husband.


I mean--
You have to let it go.


I just want to know
from the horse's mouth


what is the dealio.
You know, Michael...


Am I too short?
Michael, it has nothing
to do with your looks, okay?


It's your--
it's your personality.


I mean, you're obnoxious
and rude and--and--and...


stupid.


And you do have coffee breath,
by the way.


And--and I don't agree
about the B.O.,


But you are very, very
inconsiderate.


Really?


Really.
You're--you're--you're...


you're a great guy, okay?


I appreciate that.
Thank you.


You were very sweet.


And you stayed up with me
and talked to me


and cried with me
and I appreciate that


in this difficult time
in my life.
No, I wasn't.


I wasn't crying.


(Jan)
But I am just not
in the place right now


where I'm looking
for a relationship.


So we can still
work together,


we can still be friends,
but...


elevator bell rings


Okay?


So my looks
having nothing to do with it.


exhaling deeply
Oh, God.


(Michael)
Jan is not in a place
where she feels


she can have a relationship
right now,


and it doesn't matter
how great a guy I am.


And that is all I needed.


I'm good.
I can go home now.


phone ringing


Hey, it's 12:20.
Where the hell is Dwight?


Um, no idea.


Never missed a day,
my ass.


phone ringing


chuckles softly


phone ringing


I'm here! I'm here!


I'm here! It's okay!


It is Friday morning,


and it is another
beautiful day


in Scranton, Pennsylvania.


Oh, oh, my God.


Oh!


dialing telephone


Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up.


Oh, we have
a serious problem here.


All right, everybody,
lock the doors.


Turn off the lights.
Pretend you're not here.


Are we in danger?


There's no time
to think about it.


This is real.


Just shh, everybody.


knock at door


(Kevin)
Michael, should I call the--


What?


The I.T. tech guy and me


did not get off
to a great start.


soft piano music





You're going
to have to stop that.


I can still feel it.


Yeah, I tried
to install it myself,


but you guys
have these things


so password-protected.


That just means you
have to enter your password.


Uh...


What's your password,
Michael?


Um, it's--


Oh, 1234.


Yes.


typing on keyboard


Do you have a question
or something?


Mm, I don't think so.


About my turban maybe?


Nope, nope.


I actually wear
a turban sometimes.


You wanna see it?


I got it here.


Why do you have that?


Comedy.
It's funny.


It's--Johnny Carson, Carnac.


It's, um...


It is...


sighs


Did you have Johnny Carson
in your land?


In Pittsburgh?


Yeah, but I never
really watched him.


Oh.
You were forbidden.


No, I'm much younger than you.


I watch Conan.


All right, I'm gonna--


uh, I'm gonna get
a cup of coffee.


Do you want some coffee
or some...


No.


Tea or hummus or something?


No, thank you.


Michael--
Aah! Gah!


Sorry.
Please don't do that.


Okay, I'm sorry.
What is going on in there?


Why is he here?
What are you doing?


I can't tell you.


You have to tell me.


I don't have
to tell you anything.


Look, Michael.


I know you don't want to
have to think about this,


but if something were
to happen to you,


God forbid,


then I would need to know
in order to take over.


Dwight, nothing is
gonna happen to me. Okay?


I'm in the best shape
of my life.


Look at at this.
Grr!


Yeah, but that
doesn't matter.


You could get
a brain aneurysm.


I'm not gonna--
Or hit by a car.


Stop.
Or a bus or a train.


Or get poisoned.
Fall down a well.


Step on a mine.
Choke.


Okay, if I step on a mine
in Scranton, Pennsylvania


and die, you can have my job.
Okay?


Why don't you just go away?


There are certain things


a boss does not share
with his employees.


His salary.
That would depress them.


His bed.


It--


And I am not going
to tell them


that I'll be reading
their emails.


Email surveillance.


All the big companies
are doing it now.


It increases productivity.
It increases efficiency.


It is a necessary evil.


Well, not evil.


It's a good necessary
good thing to...do.


So how do you search?


By keyword phrase.


Try "profits."


No, try "Michael Scott."


"Michael," "boss,"
and "funny."


typing on keyboard


Oh, my God!
Wow!


chuckles
Email from Stanley.


Stanley.
Terribly nice guy.


"Sorry I didn't
write back sooner.


"I can't go
to the game tonight


"because my boss
Michael is an ass


and making me
stay late."


Well, Stanley's an ass.


Not one of our
harder workers.


clears throat


Oh, this isn't good.


It's fine.


You don't even know
what I'm talking about.


Hey, what's the deal,
Michael?


Why are you spying
on our computers?


Oh, no!


Everybody,
Oscar's gone crazy.


What other ghost stories
do you have for us?


That I bugged the office?


That I've put cameras
in the plants?


That I'm a robot?
chuckles


robotic voice
I will destroy


everything in my path.


Actually, we just--
Boop!


Beep! Bop!


Okay.
Bonk!


Boop, boop.
Oil can.


Oil can.


(Oscar)
Tin Man.


Actually we just got
a memo from I.T.


saying you're doing
email surveillance.


Oh, what?


No, that defeats
the whole purpose.


So it's true?
You have access to our emails?


Yes, yes, yes,
but it's no big deal.


I mean, a lot
of growing companies--


We're growing?


I thought we were worried
about downsizing.


Yes, we are not growing
in terms of people or jobs,


but we are growing together
as a company.


We're growing stronger,
and we're growing better


into a more--
into a more united company.


Yeah, one where
our boss spies on us.


I hear you, Stanley.
I do.


And you know what
the problem is?


I think I do.


The problem is
that when people


hear the term
"Big Brother,"


they immediately think
it's scary or bad,


but I don't, I think,


"Wow.
I love my Big Brother.


He's handsome, and he's fit,
and he's a good guy."


"And he has a lot
of helpful suggestions."


Like, here's
a helpful suggestion for Jim.


Jim, instead of
emailing Amazon


to try to get that CD
that you didn't receive,


I suggest that you go to Visa


and tell 'em
to cancel the charge.


Yeah, definitely didn't
need help with that, but, yeah.


It seems like
you did though, Jim.


Oh.


Lots of emails to Amazon.
Lots of wasted computer space.


All right,
let's get back to work.


Yeah, I assumed Michael
was already doing this.


That's why I only use
my personal email account.


I wonder if I could get
that software.


My fiancée's been acting funny.


This whole email thing
could be bad for business.


I mean my business.


I have a side job
where I do people's taxes.


I gotta erase
a lot of stuff.


A lotof stuff.


Oh, hey,
just so you know,


if you have
any sensitive emails,


they need to be
deleted immediately.


I know.


Good.


whispering
Hey.


Something just happened.


Dwight just told Angela
that she has to delete


all of her sensitive
emails immediately.


What?
I know.


Hmm.


Do you think that
they're like--


No.
Right, no.


Ugh! Ew.


Ew, ew, ew.


Maybe.


It's like squishing a spider
under a book.


It's gonna be really gross,
but I have to look


and make sure
that it's really dead.


So if you guys
see anything...


Hey, Dwight?
Um...


My friend is kind of into


these two girls
that he works with.


Nice.
One is tall and brunette.


And the other one
is short and blonde


and perky
and kind of judgmental.


Who do you think
he should choose?


Does he have access
to their medical records?


Um...


I think one of
the greatest things


about modern America
is the computerization


of medical records.


As a volunteer sheriff,
I can look up


anyone's psychiatric records
or surgical histories.


Yeast infections.


There are a huge number


of yeast infections
in this county.


Probably because
we're down river


from that old bread factory.


keyboard clacking


Should've done this
a long time ago.


Tons of personal emails.
Huge time wasters.


Ugh.


chuckles
Oh.


Wow, like, Kevin rating
the best bars in Scranton.


Poor Richard's number seven.
Ugh, idiot.


Stupid load.


phone rings


Yeah.


(Pam)
Hey, Michael.


Accounting needs
your approval on--


No, I'm busy right now.


(Michael)
Meredith has an Evite


from Jim.


"Barbecue at Jim's tonight."


Tonight.


Wonder where
my "e-vitation" is?


Click on guest list.


Angela, Stanley, Oscar,


Meredith, Phyllis,
Kevin, Creed.


Must be...


mouse clicking


No.


phone ringing


This is Pam.


No, Pam, you have to keep
your eye on the prize.


You need to keep your eye on
the horrible, horrible prize.


Yahtzee.


(Pam)
Oh.


sighs


Ooh, bleh, bleh, bleh.


Where's your tie?


I don't know.


Just felt like taking it off.


Man, work can be
just so damn frustrating.


Don't you think, Jim?


Um, yeah, I guess.


What's going on, Michael?
Talk to me.


Eh, you know, same old stuff.


Same old, you know.
Boss just been riding my ass.


Oh, no, Jan?
What's going on?


(Michael)
I don't want to talk about it.


You know,
just want to hang out,


just be one of the guys.


(Dwight) The most important one
of the guys.


(Michael)
That's not the point.


Just--


That's exactly the point.
You've hit a slump.


It happens to the best of us.


sighs


You just have
to remember, you know,


where you come from
and who you are.


Okay.


You know, you have worked
so hard for this.


You are the boss.


You can buy and sell us


with just a snap
of your little finger.


Yes, well,
I would never do that.


Yeah, no one can snap
with their little finger.


Jim, this is hardly the time.


No, this is
completely the time.


This is the perfect time.


This is just guys
gently ribbing each other.


That's what it's all about.


Hanging out.
Enjoying friends.


All being the same.


Worker bees.


And their king bee.


(Michael) No, just bees.
Just bees hanging out.


Buzzing around.


(Dwight)
The master bee.


I am not a master bee.
(Dwight) Queen bee.


I'm just a bee, Dwight, okay?


Just a bee.
Just buzzing.


Hey, Angela.
How's it going?


It's okay.


Listen, are you
bringing anyone


to Jim's party tonight?


No.
Are we supposed to?


No.


I mean, I don't know.
I don't think so.


Hmm.
Excuse me.


Oh.


There's always a distance


between a boss
and the employees.


It is just nature's rule.


It's intimidation mostly.


It's the awareness
that they are not me.


You see, they're thinking,


"Wow, Michael Scott.
I really respect him.


"What'll I do if I
drop spinach dip on him


"at a party?
What is he gonna think of me?


"What--is it gonna
affect my salary?


Ooh, Michael Scott."


I don't know.
I don't know.


I do think
that I am very approachable


as one of the guys.


laughs


But maybe I need to be
even "approachabler."


clears throat


That's pretty, um--
Yeah.


Are you gonna
eat with us?


Of course.
Hanging with my crew.


Crew that I am one of.


Hanging with
my cup of noodles.


This is a meal in a cup
right here.


Hot, tasty.


Ah, man.
So how's your day been so far--


I'm sorry this is so late.
Oh.


There was a big order
right before yours,


but they threw in
a free spicy tuna roll, so--


You know what?
I don't need that.


I got my lunch.
What?


I got my lunch.
I'm good, I'm good.


You don't want this?
No.


You know,
why don't you keep it?


Tell you what, better yet,
put it in the fridge


and put my name on it.


Thanks.


I got my cup of noodles


Mmm.


Reminds me of college.


Lived on this stuff.
Brain food. Mmm.


You know what I really,
really miss about college?


The parties.
Everybody'd go.


The athletes, the nerds,
professors.


The professors
would go to the parties?


Yeah.
They were the most fun.


We always invited them.


(Jim)
It's true.


I'm having a party.


I've got three cases
of imported beer,


karaoke machine,


and I didn't invite Michael.


So three ingredients
for a great party.


And it's nothing personal.


I just think that
if he were there,


people wouldn't be able
to relax,


you know, have fun.


And my roommate
wants to meet everybody


because I'm pretty sure
he thinks I'm making Dwight up.


He is very real.


Hi.
Hey, babe, hey.


Hey.
How are you?


Good.
You look good.


Thank you.


Hey, um, I was wondering
if it might be okay


if I go to Lonny's
poker game tonight.


I promise it'll be, like,
the last time for a while.


We're supposed to go
to the barbecue at Jim's house.


Oh, man.


Um, could you go without me?


Make something up?
Say I ate something or--


sighs


Huh?
Huh?


You're the best.
You're the best.


I might be late.


Okay, don't wake me up


'cause I'm playing ball
in the morning.


Okay.
All right, bye.


Did I miss anything?


Hey, Jim.
What's up, Kev?


Hey, um, I know
it's kind of last minute,


but I was wondering
if it would be cool


if I brought
my fiancée tonight.


Oh, yeah, totally.


It's totally casual,
so not really worried


about numbers or whatever.


Cool.
All right?


Thanks.
Yeah, definitely.


What?


Oh.
Yes!


Thank you.


Question.


On the Internet,


there are several
different options


to get to your house
for the party tonight.


-Oh, uh, no, no.
-And I was wondering--


No, no, no.
Keep that down.


Why?


Because not everybody
knows about the party.


Like who?
Who doesn't know?


Um, Michael.


Why just Michael?


Because it's a surprise.


Is it?
Mm-hmm.


Oh, that's perfect.


So don't tell.


I won't.
Okay.


So Dwight thinks
that tonight


is a surprise party
for Michael.


Really? That's great.
I know.


Maybe we can get him to hide
and wait somewhere.


chuckles


Oh, man.
Oh, you know what?


Speaking of which,
I was just trying


to get a handle on,
you know,


numbers and--
for food and stuff,


so do you think
Roy's gonna come or--


Oh, no.
He can't make it.


Oh, okay.
Cool.


Hey there.
Hey.


Almost quitting time.


Yep.
It's 4:00.


One more hour


to take care of anything
you forgot to do.


clears throat
Hey, you know,


I don't know if you have
any plans tonight,


but if you don't,
we could hang out.


Oh, um...I can't.


You have plans?
Mm-hmm, yeah, I do.


Yeah, I do too,
I do too.
Oh, you do?


Big plans.
I do, yeah.


Because you just said that
you wanted to hang out--


Tonight,
I can't do it tonight.


No. Improv class.
I have improv class.


Hanging out with
my improv buds.
Really?


Yeah.
Oh, that sounds
like a lot of fun.


Oh, it's the best.
It is the best.


I would not miss it
for the world,


but if something else came up,
I would definitely not go.


Improv sounds great.


It is.


Okay.


All right.


Stanley coughs


What?


I think Stanley
just coughed.


5:00.


Time to go get my improv on.


Little bit of the comedy juice.


Mmm, all right, see if you
can guess what this is.


growling


That is a dinosaur
getting ready


to go to improv class.


Just a taste of the improv.


Hey, Pam, do you need me


to walk you
to your vehicular transport?


No, thanks.


All right.


Oscar, do you have
big plans tonight--


I'm on a call.
Okay.


Kevin, big man, big man,
what are you doing tonight?


Where you off to?


My brother is in town,


and we are going to see
the Alaska Film Festival at--


Okay, all right.
Oh.


Hey, Angela.
Rushy, rushy.


Where you rushing off to?


I'm just leaving
for the day.


Yeah, well, duh.
Where you headed?


Charity.
Bake Drive.


Liar!


No!
You are a liar.


No, I'm not!


sighs
Dwight.


Oh, Dwight,
my loyal compadre.


You and I
are hanging tonight.


The two of us.
We are celebrating


our freedom
and our manhood.


You know what?


Why don't we watch that show
you've been wanting to watch?


That stupid Battleship Galaxy--


Battlestar Galactica?


That's--whatever stupid show
you want to watch.


I can't tonight.
Unfortunately, I've got plans.


I have to go to practice.
Soccer practice.


I didn't know you played
soccer, Dwight.


Clarinet.


You too, Dwight?


Have fun tonight.


Whatever it is
that you're doing.


And I'll see you Monday.


whispering
He has no idea.


soft rock music


Quick announcement,
everybody.


If I could have
everybody's attention.


We do have wine
in the kitchen,


and there is beer
available on the porch,


and despite
what you might think,


it's not all
for Meredith and Kelly,


so please enjoy.


Jim, you really think
this is a good idea?


Huh?
A hide-a-key rock?


Hey, you must be Dwight.


You don't work with us.


That's because
Mark's my roommate.


Oh.
So...


Hey, I love
the Birkenstocks.


Thanks.


Yeah, I always keep
an extra set in the car


for special occasions.


Jim, come here.
Mm-hmm?


When is the guest
of honor coming?


Oh.
Uh, later-ish.


He's gonna love it!


Great.


I just wanted
to let you guys know


that we will be taking
the tour like I promised--


Hey.
Hey!


Just in time.


Do you want to go
on a group tour?


-We were just about to leave.
-Definitely.


Well, the group tour
is now leaving then.


Ladies and gentlemen,
just a few things


that we're gonna be
pointing out to you today.


You will be able
to see both bedrooms,


and if we're lucky,


maybe get a chance
to peek into the bathroom.


Who knows?


I have to remind you also


that flash photography
is prohibited.


And as much as you can,


please refrain
from touching things.


I know you might want to.


Hey, is Katie coming?


Um, actually I haven't
talked to her in a while.


Huh?
Oh.


Is it cool if I call her?


(Jim) We can talk
about that later.


Watch me enter my comfort zone.


Ah, they can't even start
without me.


Hello!


Okay, let's get
right into it.


I need two people
for the first scene.


Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Mr. Kotter!


Mr. Kotter!


Okay.
Michael.


And...


Anybody?


How about Marybeth?


Okay.
Come on.


Okay, so you start
us off, Marybeth.


All right, great.


La la la la la


Boom!
Detective Michael Scarn!


I'm with the FBI!


Think about this.


What is the most exciting thing


that can happen on TV
or in movies


or in real life?
Somebody has a gun.


That's why I always start
with a gun


because you can't top it.
You just can't.


Okay, Bill,
why don't you start us off?


And I want you guys to jump in


when you have an idea,
all right?


Okay, so let's start him up.


applause


Thirsty.
So incredibly thirsty.


Welcome to
the Sahara Desert Latte Hut.


Would you like to try
a green iced tea blended?


students chuckle


Just water.


Uh, I'm supposed to meet
my doctor here.


Have you seen him?
He's a very angry midget.


Boom! Freeze!


Michael Scoon, FBI!
You know what you did.


Boom, boom, boom!


Yeah, you thought
you could get away


with your little ruse
didn't you? Didn't you?


Well, you didn't.


Because I know where
you hid the diamonds.


I've been onto you


and your little friends
for weeks.


Boom, boom, boom!


I'm not even in the scene!


-Boom, boom, boom!
-Stop, okay, stop.


Stop!
They're not--stop!


-Boom!
-Okay, you shot me.


-Great. Stop.
-What?


Okay, you can't just shoot
everyone in the scene.


Well, if you hadn't
stopped the scene,


you would've seen
where it was going.


Okay, what about
the scene they set up?


Boring.


No, it wasn't.
No more guns.


-Could've--
- No, no.


Michael, I want you to give me
all the guns you have.


Just get rid of all your guns
and give them to me.


Great.
Bleh!


Bleh.
Okay.


So if you just step
into this room,


uh, yeah, look around.


You might find a few clues
about who lives here.


He likes biking, obviously,
and what else?


Uh, he likes tour guides,
I guess,


and if you're very perceptive,


you'll notice
that he didn't do


a great job cleaning his room.


Okay, and that's the to--


And he's really into penguins
or something?


Um, thank you, Ryan.
Uh, no, I don't know.


I think I made
the mistake one day


of telling someone
I liked penguins,


and here we are.


I'm sorry.
I gave you that penguin.


And that's why
it's on my desk, Phyllis.


It means a lot to me, and now
that I know it's from you,


it means even more.


Moving on.


Okay, for the next exercise,
let's everyone pair up.


claps


(improv teacher)
Partner and...


everybody got somebody?


-Uh-huh.
-Okay, good.


Um, okay.


Nobody ever wants to fight
the heavyweight champ.


Nobody wants that title shot.


I'll just throw in
some suggestions.


(improv teacher)
Okay, you guys want to start?


Don't throw in any suggestions.


-They're in a whorehouse...
-Okay.


We don't need
a suggestion for this one.


-And he's a proctologist.
-Okay.


This one's gonna
come from them.


This one's gonna
come from them.


A game called Yes, And.


And you will say
the first sentence.


You're telling a story--


First sentence is,
"I am a proctologist."


We're not gonna get
a suggestion on this one.


It's gonna come
from them, okay?


Jim's bedroom.


See, I knew we lost
somebody on the tour.


Cool.
This is your desk.


This is my desk.


Your home office.


Home office.
This is it.
Yeah.


You have to sit down
so I can get the full effect.


Okay, sure.
Will do.


Okay, wait.
So that would make me...


Like right here.


Yeah, yep,
that feels about right.


And then Dwight
would be like--


Um, you know what?


Let's just leave
that image out of it


because this is a happy place.


Happy thoughts, Pam.
Happy thoughts.


Um...
gasps


Yearbook.


Yeah, you don't
have to, um--


All right.


Yes, that's not gonna
be awkward at all.


laughs
Oh, no!
Oh, yeah.


You were so dorky!
Thank you.


laughs


(improv teacher)
Freeze.
I'm in.


Do you want to go over
the rules one more time?


No, no, no, no.


I'm looking
in my wallet for money


so you can tell me
my fortune.


I promise it's worth it.


Ooh, I can see you
walking out of here,


and you're thrilled
with your reading.


class chuckles


What are you--


whispering


Michael,
what did you tell him?


Nothing.


Then why are his hands up?
Bill?


He told me he couldn't
show it to me,


but he has a gun.


Okay.
Let's call it a day.


Nice job.


Good.
That was good.


Good work, everybody.


Improv's hit or miss.
Last week I was on fire.


Just Robin Williams, Ali G,
Ryan Stiles, nailing it.


Home runs every--
every swing of the bat.


Um, this week, I was paired up
with some pretty lame people,


so you have to deal with that.


"Whose Line Is It Anyway?"


It's Michael Scott's line
'cause, generally,


Michael Scott's
is the funniest line.


Hey, I love that playhouse.


Oh, yeah, thanks,
belongs to the owners.


Mm, I'd love
to get one like that.


-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.


Interesting.


Totally forgot you had a kid.
Sorry about that.


Interesting.


Angela.


Burger, dog?
Having fun?


I got sap on me.


Chicken, hot dog, burger?


I'm a vegetarian.


-There's soda inside.
-Ugh.


I didn't think the premium
laser color copy batch


would sell as well as it did.


It surprised us all.
I'll tell you why.


-Because--
-I'm sorry, guys.


Can we please
not talk about paper?


There's gotta be something else
that we could talk about.


clears throat


mellow music playing


(Angela)
Um, I think it's all right.


I mean, Jesus drank wine.


(Pam)
Hmm.


Hey, Phyllis.


Come here for a second.
Sure.


Have you heard anything


about any secret
office romances or--


You tell me.


Well, you do mean
you and Jim, right?


Oh, God.
I am so sorry.


I mean, I thought--


you guys hang out
all the time,


and you're talking
all the time, and I--


I'm sorry.
It's like--


Oh, it's okay.
It's okay.


Why don't you turn it up?


Ah!


Not so fast, fire guy.


Think we need
some more heat, fire guy?


Hey, fire guy, maybe we should
burn Jim's house down.


That's really funny.


Hey, Kelly,
I called him fire guy.


Good one, Kev.


Yeah.


Hey, Stanley--


He called me fire guy.


Oh, good one.
chuckles


It never gets old.


Never gets old.


How do we get to
Bernie's Tavern from here?


Oh, don't worry.
We're all gonna carpool.


So Bernie's, huh?
We're all going to Bernie's?


Oh, uh, sorry.
We're not going as a group.


It's just a private friend


who happens to know
all of us from different ways


is throwing a private
birthday thing.


Right, right, right, right,
well, guys, I'd love to go


to Bernie's with you,
but you know what?


I have an office party.


Big office party
I need to go to.


-Okay, see you next week.
-Can't get out of it.


Good job.
Hey, see you later.


Nice job, Bill.
Not.


Here I go again
on my own


rock music playing


Going down the only road
I've ever known


Oh, hey, how's your
new side project going?


Um, oh, yeah.
I gave that up.


Really?
Yeah, it turns out
I was, um,


just grasping at straws.


Just because two people
are hanging out,


it doesn't mean
that they're together.


You know? Like, people
can just be friends.


And I think that it was
really unfair of us


to assume that there was
anything else going on.


Just turn around now


'Cause you're not
welcome anymore


And I--
And I've got--


Surprise!


laughs
Everybody.


Wow, who opened the morgue
for this thing?


I was just driving by.
Thought I'd drop in.


There's some wine.


I would love a glass
if you're gonna open it.


Hello, temp.
Take my jacket.


laughs


Oh, come on.
That guy?


He is a good guy,
not a terrorist.


Yikes.


Karaoke.
I love it.


I am a karaoke fiend!


I call dibs.
I got next.


I got next up.
Come on, let's--


Let's get
this party started


Ha! Okay.
Where's that wine?


Okay, this is a duet, so...


Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers'
"Islands In the Stream"


Need somebody else?
Pam, you want to...


come up and sing this one?


Need somebody else.
Takers, please.


Baby, when I met you
there was peace unknown


Kelly?


I tried to get you
with a fine tooth comb


I was soft inside


There was something
going on


This is the part
that goes to the girl.


high-pitched
You do something to me


That I can't explain


Hold me closer
and I feel no pain


Every beat of my heart


We've got something
going on





Tender love is blind


singing together
It requires a dedication


All this love we feel
needs no conversation


Divide it together,
uh-huh


Making love
with each other, uh-huh


We're making love!


singing together
Islands in the stream


That is what we are


No one in-between


How can we be wrong?


Sail away with me


Talk! Just talk!


I am--
Shut up!


Funny story--
the way I got into improv


was--I got into improv--


the story about me
getting into improv was


that I was walking
down the street,


and a race car pulls up,


and the guy says,
"Hey, you're funny.


"You're the funniest guy
I've ever seen.


Or my name
is not Dale Earnhardt."


snorting laugh


And thatwas an improv.


Um, the real way was
that I found a flyer.


trumpet blows


(Jim)
Hey.


Hello.


Jim!


What's up, buddy?
This is not funny.


(Dwight)
Why is my stuff in here?


(Jim)
Wow, that's weird.


Ooh, dollar for a stapler,
that's pretty good.


Yeah, well, I'm not paying
for my own stuff, okay?


I know you did this


'cause you're friends
with the vending machine guy.


Who, Steve?


Yeah, Steve.
Oh, sorry.


Or whatever his name is.
What do I want, what do I want?


Ooh, it's a pencil cup.


(Dwight)
Oh, no, no, no, no.


That's my pencil cup.


Um, I don't think so.
I just bought it.


Uh, I think so, and you're
going to hand it over to me.


I love these.


Okay, fine.


Where's my wallet?


Um.


(Jim)
Oh, there it is. J1.


Here, you know what?
I don't have any--


You can have
some nickels.


5, 10.


15, 20, 25...


soft piano music





upbeat music





Are you all packed?
Yes.


I brought my duffel bag and a
sleeping bag just in case.


Where do you guys think we're
going?


Definitely someplace
you can swim.


Right?
Maybe, um, Florida.


Did you hear something?


Hello, everyone.


Morning, Michael.


Where are we going
this afternoon?


Nah, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.


Last week, Michael sent out
this mysterious memo.


"It's time for our first
quarter camaraderie event.


"So pack a swimsuit,
a toothbrush,


"rubber-soled shoes,


and a ski mask."


A ski mask
and a swimsuit.


So that he can
have us rob a bank


and then escape
through the sewers.


laughing
And brush our teeth.


knocking
Yeah?


Michael.


Stanley...bo banley.


I need to know--


Banana fanna fo fanley.


(Stanley)
What we're doing.
Me mi mo manley.


You said bring
a toothbrush.


Stanley.


Is this an overnight?


Maybe. The suspense is just
so exciting, isn't it?


Should my wife tell her boss
she's not coming in tomorrow?


Maybe, I don't know.
Not maybe. Yes or no.


Well, no, but...okay,
don't spoil it for everybody.


All right?
But we...


inhales deeply
Are going on a booze cruise


on Lake Wallenpaupack.


In January?


It's cheaper.


This is not just
another party.


This is a leadership
training exercise.


Right?


I'm going to combine elements
of fun and motivation


and education into a single,
mind-blowing experience.


So this is--


door slams


Well, we're not going
to Florida.


Oh.
Someplace with a pool, then?


Jan knocks on door
Yeah.


Hello, Michael.
(Michael)
Hello.


(Jan)
Can we come in?
Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah.


Thank you very much.


sighs
Oh. Every man's dream.


Oh, really?
A surprise visit from his boss?


Two ladies at once.


What?


(Michael)
Why are you looking
at me like that?


Okay, you heard something.


Um, yeah.
It's a booze cruise,


but it's--there's more
to the story than that.


A booze cruise?


What do you mean?


Leadership off-site.


Uh, booze cruise
is just a rhyme.


And Michael, we discussed
the IRS's regulations.


Yeah, I got--I don't even know
why I said booze cruise.


This event has to have
legitimate business content


to be tax-deductible.
We discussed that.


(Michael)
Of--of course, of course,
of course.


Yes, yes. Look, I have
a whole program planned.


Jan, this program is going
to change people's lives.


I am going to be dropping
serious knowledge


all over the boat.


Good.


This is Brenda Matlowe
from corporate training.


Hello.


I thought that she could
attend tonight


and if your event
is appropriate,


you could give it
to other branches.


Oh, cool, cool.


And maybe you could attend
tonight


and then you could stay over
at my house...


sighs
(Michael)
For the night.


Awkward.


That's--you know what, Brenda?


Could Jan and I have a moment
alone?


Jan said if you asked me that,
I was supposed to say no.


Really?
You seriously said that?


sighing
Okay, Brenda.


Could Jan and I have
a moment alone?


Sure.
Brenda.


(Michael)
Thanks.
I mean no.


Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna go now.


And, um--clears throat


Okay.
See you later.


Okay.
See you later.


And, um, try to be
professional.
I'll call you later.


(Jan)
That's all right.
You call me--


youcall me if
you need anything, right?


Uh-huh.
(Michael)
I'll call you, too.


So...


you're probably gonna get
carded.


So, um, I can make you
a fake ID.


We have a laminating machine.


It is now time to unveil


the destination
of this year's retreat.


We are going
on a harbor cruise


of Lake Wallenpaupack.


Oscar clears throat


It's a booze cruise.


All right.


I have a test for business
school tomorrow night.


Is it okay if skip the cruise
and study for that?


No, this is mandatory.


But don't worry, you know what?
You're going to learn plenty.


This is going to turn
your life around, Ryan.


I'm already in business school.
(Michael)
Well--


(Kelly)
Wait, Michael?


(Michael)
Yeah?


Um, why did you tell us
to bring a bathing suit?


To throw you off the scent.


Yeah, but I bought
a bathing suit.


Well, just keep the tags on
and you can return it.


I took the tags off already.


Well, that's not
my fault, okay?


Just--we're not going
to pay for a bathing suit.


Okay. I know what
you're all thinking.


Who is this smart,
little cookie?


Her name is Brenda...


something, and she
is from corporate.


And she is here, like you, to
learn from what I have to say.


I am a great
motivational speaker.


I attended a Tony Robbins event
by the airport last year,


and...


it wasn't the actual course.


You have to pay
for the actual course.


But, it talkedabout
the actual course.


And I've incorporated


a lot of his ideas
into my own course.


Leader...


ship.


The word ship is hidden inside
the word leadership


as its derivation.


So, if this office
is in fact a ship,


as its leader...


I am the captain.


But...


We're all in the same boat.
Teamwork.


Last year, Michael's theme was
"bowl over the competition."


So guess where we went?


Now, on this ship
that is the office,


what is the sales department?


Anyone?
Oscar, what do you think?


I don't--I don't know what
the categories are


of workers on a boat.


I'm not giving you the answer.


Deck hands is one.


Oh, oh.
Can I be the first mate?


No. I'm first mate.
You're second mate.


I'm first mate as the captain.


How about the sales department
is the sails?


Yes, Daryl.


The sales department
makes sales. Good.


Let me just explain.


I see the sales department


as the furnace.


A furnace?
Yeah.


Yeesh, how old
is this ship?


How about the anchor?


Well, the anchor
is the only thing


that kind of slows
the ship down.


Toby's the anchor.


Oh, God.


He--I'll tell you
about Toby later.


He's awful.


Yeah, I know Toby
from Jan's birthday.


Hey, Brenda.
Hey.


Okay, Toby.
So--


What does the furnace do?


All right, let's not get
hung up on the furnace.


This just--
sighs


It's the sales--


I see the sales department
are down there.


They're in the engine room


and they are shoveling
coal into the furnace, right?


I mean who saw
the movie Titanic?


They were very important
in the movie Titanic.


Who saw it?
Show of hands.


Not really sure what movie
you're talking about.


You sure you got
the title right?


Titanic.


I think you're thinking of
The Hunt for Red October.


No, I'm--
Leo DiCaprio, come on!


Michael stands in
the front of the boat


and says that he's king of the
world within the first hour,


or I give you
my next paycheck.


Michael, everyone in
the engine room drowned.


No--thank you.
Spoiler alert.


You saw the movie,
those of you who did.


stutters


They're happy down there
in the furnace room.


And they're dirty and grimy
and sweaty.


And they're singing
their ethnic songs.


And--actually,
that might be warehouse.


What?


The--no--


No, I didn't--


Okay, well, the--


Okay, in a nutshell what I'm
saying is leadership.


We'll get--we'll talk more
about that on the boat--ship.


Aye, aye, Captain.


(Michael)
A three-hour tour


A three-hour tour


Pam, you are Mary Ann!


We have...


The Professor and Ginger.


Welcome aboard.


Angela, you are Mrs. Howell.


Lovey.


Uh, the native.


Sometimes they come
from neighboring--


Oh, uh, we have, uh...


one of the Globetrotters.


I am the Skipper.


And Dwight,
you will be Gilligan.


Cool!


Actually, I'm the Skipper.


Okay.
But you could
be Gilligan.


Oh, I'd rather die.


Hi.
I am Michael Scott.


I am the Captain
of this party.


I'm Captain Jack.


I'm captain of the ship.
Ahh!


I'm also captain of anyone
who sets foot on the ship.


Hi, welcome aboard.


Okay.


In an office,
when you are ranking people,


manager is higher than captain.


On a boat, who knows?


It's nebul-ose.


Hey, look.


I'm king of the world!


Dwight laughing
(Michael)
Woo!


Jim mouths words
(Dwight)
Woo!


(Michael)
Hey!


What's wrong with you?
You missed the boat.


I got lost!


Idiot.


We can go back.
No, no, no!


That's his punishment
for not being here on time.


Too bad, anchor!


I guess I shouldn't have
stopped for dinner.


(Michael and Dwight)
Woo!


(Captain Jack)
Okay, all right.


Welcome aboard.


I am your captain,
Captain Jack.


And I am the Regional Manager
of Dunder Mifflin,


Michael Scott.


(Michael)
Welcome, welcome.


Okay, so, um--
Okay, so.


Please.
The, uh, life preservers.


(Michael)
Right.


They are located underneath the
seats all along the perimeter


But don't worry.
of the boat.


You are not going to be needing
life preservers tonight.


Well, we might be, okay?
This is just gonna be--


Please let me finish, okay?
Well--


Thank you.


So the Coast Guard requires


that I tell you where
the safety exits are.


Now, on this ship,
it's very easy.


Anywhere over the side.


Dwight laughs


Not only am I
your ship's captain,


I am also
your party captain!


Woo! We're going
to get it going here


in just a few minutes--


And I am your
party captain too!


And you are going to put
on your dancing shoes


later on.
Hey, Mike, Mike.


So, we are gonna--


Uh, if you don't mind.
Rock it! what?


(Captain Jack)
Please, okay?


If the boat's a-rocking,
don't come knocking.


Michael!
Yup.


Uh, your company employees


are not the only people
on the boat tonight, okay?


We're all gonna have
a good time tonight.


Hey, hey,
listen, Mike.


Why don't you let me
and my crew do our job?


You just sit back--
Mm-hmm.


And have
a good time, okay?
Okay, yup.


All right?
All right.


On the high seas,
Captain Jack is the leader.


On the land, it's Michael.


On the ramp up to the boat,
I was a bit conflicted.


But now that I'm here?
inhales deeply


I'll follow this captain
to hell and back.


Hey, Captain Jack. What kinda
fish they got in this lake?


Perch, bass.


You know, my grandfather told
me there was a monster here


that eat Catholics.
Have you heard?


I hadn't heard that, Dwight.


If the hull is breached
for any reason


or the boat is overtaken,


I am a volunteer
sheriff's deputy


and you can count on me.


(Captain Jack)
That's good to know, Dwight.
Thanks.


Your problem now,
Captain Jack.


You guys,


it's like we're
in high school


and we're at
the cool table.


laughing
Right?


Yeah.


Pam, were you a cheerleader?


No, she was total little Miss
Artsy Fartsy in high school.


She wore the turtleneck
and everything.


That's hilarious.
laughing


It's not hilarious,
but--


Where'd you
go to school?


Bishop O'Hara.


"Piss la poo
cares-uh"?


We played you.


You--you really
look familiar.


Did you, uh--You cheered
for them, didn't you?


Mm, no.


Yes, I did.


A-W-E


S-O-M-E


Awesome, awesome
is what we are


we're the football
superstars


A-W-E
I remember that!


S-O-M-E
We crushed you, like, 42-10.


Having fun?
Yeah.


Everybody's really nice.


Good, well, that is what
Scranton is all about.


Not like you "New Yawkers."


I just moved there.
Yeah, I hear ya, I hear ya.


You know Jan and I were
intimate, right?


She ever mention me and the
fact that were intimate?


No.


Good.
That's professional.


Respecting privacy.


When are you going
to start the, uh--


What?
The, uh, presentation?


Well, I already sort of
started it back at the office


and on the dock with
the Gilligan thing.


So, right now,
I was thinking.


Yes.


Okay!


Listen up,


all you, Dunder Mifflinites!


I would like to talk to you
all about


life preservers.


Now, one important
life preserver


in business is IT Support.


chuckles Not now Mike,
we're doing the limbo!


laughing
That's right, partiers.


It's time to limbo,
limbo, limbo!


So, okay.
All right!


(Captain Jack)
I need a volunteer


to come up here
and hold my stick.


Huh, who's it gonna be?


Me.
Me, me, me, me, me, me!


Me, me, me.


Uh.


Usually, it's a woman.


I'm stronger.


Hey, I got an idea.


How would you like
to steer the ship, Dwight?


Keep us on a steady course.


Keep a sharp eye out,
I'm counting on you.


(Dwight)
I was the youngest pilot
in Pan Am history.


When I was four, the pilot
let me ride in the cockpit


and fly the plane with him.


And I was four
and I was great!


And I would have landed it,


but my dad wanted us
to go back to our seats.


laid-back music playing


cheering





Hey.


You know what the best way
of studying is?


At home?
Not on a boat?


Flash cards.
Flash cards.


Doesn't really help me right
now because I'm on a boat.


You are gonna get seasick
if you keep reading in there.





cheering


(Captain Jack)
All right, all right.


That was great, now it's time
for the dance contest!


Why don't we do that after
I do my presentation and--


Nope!
Dance contest!


All right, we'll have a
motivationaldance contest.


Hit it!


Yeah, okay!


Dancing!


It is a primal art form
used in ancient times


to express yourself
with the body!


(Michael)
And communicate!


rhythmic slapping





Sometimes you have
to take a break


from being the kind of boss


that's always trying
to teach people things.


Sometimes you have to just
to be the boss of dancing.

Hey, come inside
and talk to me.


I can't.


Do you want us
to run aground, woman?


sighs





Yeah! laughs
applause


All right, all right!
That was awesome!


All right, looks like


the guitar player's gonna take
a little break.


So this'll be a great time to
head on over to the taco bar.


All right.


That is a great way to kill
this party.


Not on my watch.


Let's, uh, let's rock.


Let's rock some stuff here,
okay?


playing poorly
Wow. Okay.


feedback screeching


I'm hearing
a little too much reverb.


feedback screeching


feedback dies down
Can we down the reverb?


All right.


Follow my lead.


playing "Smoke on the Water"
poorly





(Michael)
Do you guys know that?
Take the bass.


Michael playing
"Smoke on the Water" poorly





Michael playing wrong notes


Take the drums.





What?


Do you want me
to give it a shot?


Just--
You know what?


I don't think it's in--
I don't--


Well, I--
Michael strums guitar


That's not in tune.
I don't know if you can--


(Creed)
I don't know.


Make much out of it, Creed.


All right.
Good luck to you.


I don't know.


It is a defective axe,
my friend.


Uh, guys.
E blues. Follow me.


Okay?


Creed playing rock
music very well





Yeah!





Back in the '60s,
I was with the Grass Roots


and we toured
with Janis Joplin,


the Doors, Cream.


We had a lot of fun.


Now, I do quality assurance
for a paper company.


As you can imagine, uh,
drugs played a part.


They still do.
I, uh...


my work calls last
about 90 seconds


and that's about as
long as I can concentrate.


Creed soloing





Those slide moves are just
bush league.


I hope I die before I'm old.


groans
Why are we here?


You don't even like
these people.





Snorkel shots,
snorkel shots!


Snorkel shots,
snorkel shots!


Snorkel shots!


cheers and applause


Woo! Who's next?


Come on, Pammy,
come on, come on!


No, I'm not doing that.


Come on!


Ay ay ay ay ay!


Tequila!


Woo!
Oy!


That's what I'm
talking about.


Hey, why don't we find,


like, a quieter place
to hang out?
grunts and sniffles


You know what? I've just got to
wait for Daryl to do his shot.


Just a minute.


Come on, Daryl, Daryl!
trilling


vomits


Por favor, tequilas, señor.


I think you've had enough.


What you say, bitch?


You know what?
You might be right.


Wow, wow.
chuckling


That was amazing.


I thought he was gonna
kill you.


which I would not have allowed.


What are you looking at?


It's getting kind of
rowdy down there.


Yeah.


"Daryl, Daryl, Daryl."
laughing


Sometimes I just don't get Roy.


clicks tongue
Well.


I mean, I don't know.


So.


What's it like dating
a cheerleader?


chuckles sarcastically
Pam chuckles


Oh...um.


I'm cold.


upbeat rock music





I'm gonna see if I can sit in
with the band.


I wouldn't.
I've heard your stuff.


You can be nasty
when you drink.


You and Angela are the worst.


So, what's this presentation
all about?


Ah, see, this is
of general interest.


It is about...priorities.


And making decisions


using the boat
as an analogy.


What is important
to you?


If the boat is sinking,
what do you save?


Women and children.


No, no.


Salesmen and profit centers.


That's a stupid analogy.


Okay.
Well, obviously,


you don't know anything
about leadership.


Well, I was the captain


of a PC-1 Cyclone
Coastal Patrol Boat


during Desert Storm.


Wow, you should be
the motivational speaker.


Him?
Okay.


Yeah, he gives me
real responsibility, Michael.


Captain Jack delegates.


He's let me steer the ship
for the last hour.


I'd like to be engaged.


How did you manage
to pull that off?


laughing Um.


Uh, I've been engaged
for three years


and there's no end
in sight,


so you don't want to ask
my advice.


Suppose your office
building's on fire.


Jim.


Who would you save?


Um...let's see, uh...


The customer.
'Cause the customer is king.


Not what I was looking for,
but a good thought.


He's just sucking up.


When you were
in the Navy,


did you, um,
ever almost die?


(Captain Jack)
Oh yeah, oh yeah.


And I wasn't
thinking about


some customer.


I was thinking about
my first wife.


The day I got back
on shore, I married her.


You know what?
I would save the receptionist.


I just wanted to clear that up.





(Roy)
Hey, everybody,


could I have your attention
for just a second?


Would you listen
to me for a second?


Um, we were up
at the front


and we were talking about
what's really important and--


Pam, um...


I think enough is enough.


I think we should set a date
for our wedding.


'Bout June 10th?


Woo!
(Roy)
Come on, let's do it.


cheers and applause


(Roy)
Come on, baby!


cheers and applause


Oh, my God,
congratulations!


Whoo!
Congratulations.


Yes!


Oh, my God!


(Roy)
I love you, baby.
Come on!


(person)
Woo, congratulations!


cheers and applause


You know what, I don't want
to take credit for this.


But Roy and I were just
having a conversation


about making commitments
and making choices, right?


Did I motivate you?


No, it was,
it was Captain Jack.


Well--
Captain Jack!


Could have
been either one of us


because, pretty much,
we were saying the same thing.


Congratulations,
that is great.


We gotta celebrate!


cheers and applause


(Captain Jack)
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
I got an idea, I got an idea.


I can marry you right now
as captain of the ship, huh?


Yes!


I can marry you as Regional
Manager of Dunder Mifflin!


No, no, no, no, I want
my mom and dad to be there.


Then, I'll give you away!


No, thank you.


upbeat music





We should make a toast.


No, I really don't want--


Oh, come on.
Don't be shy.


Everybody!


There's a toast.
Come on!


(Michael)
Yeah, toast!


(Katy)
Yeah, toast, toast, toast!


applause


Nice, Katy.
Um...


Didn't really, uh prepare
anything to say.


Uh, we were all caught
pretty unprepared


with this whirlwind courtship.


laughter


Um...


I guess I just wanna say
that Pam is...


The greatest.


My best friend.


And she's awesome


and--
Okay, okay, my turn, my turn.


All right.
Is this thing on?


Uh, I want to congratulate
the happy couple.


You know, they say that
marriage is an institution.


And I say who wants to be
in an institution?


That's my line!
That's my line.


That's--
I always say that at weddings.


sighs


So I'll just think
of something else to say.


I...


rock music playing





This is wonderful.


Oh, shut up, Phyllis.





Grover Washington Jr's
"Just the Two of Us"





Do you think that'll
ever be us?


No.


What is wrong
with you?


Why did you even
bring me here tonight?


I don't know.
Let's break up.


Wh-what?


both chuckling
This is where old
Captain Jack drives the boat.


(Meredith)
Wow. chuckles


Seasick?


Captain Jack says
you should look at the moon.


Captain Jack's a fart face.


vomiting


I'm on medication.


Really, what?


Vomicillin.
coughs


Okay, all right,
it's time to be bossy.


Time to motivate,
let's blow some minds here.


Okay, guys, guys,
guys, cool it.


Everybody. Dunder Mifflin
Scranton employees,


(Michael)
Brenda.


I have some very, very urgent
news I need to tell everybody.


Right now, listen up.


The ship is sinking.


Okay?


We're going down
right now.


Just wrap your heads around
the reality of that.


(Pam)
What?


Shh, please, everybody,
it's my turn now, okay?


Captain Jack is gone.


In five minutes,
this ship is going to be


at the bottom of the lake


and there aren't enough spaces
on the lifeboat.


Who are we going to save?


Do we save sales?


Do we save
customer service?


Do we save accounting?


This is a business scenario,
right?


(Captain Jack)
Hey, hey!


It's a scary--
splashing


What the hell's going on here?
It's a predicament.


Get outta here, what the--


(Michael)
And it's something that
each and every one of us


have to think about.


I'm in the brig, see?


Boat size corporate friendly,
as advertised.


What is the deal with
the guy jumping overboard?


What was--


If he had just waited
and heard what I had to say,


he would be motivated right now
and not all wet.


sighs loudly


Grover Washington Jr's
"Just the Two of Us"





Somebody there?


What happened to you?


sighs


Captain Jack has a problem
with authority.


Oh, right, 'cause you announced
that his ship was sinking?


Yeah.
He just totally lost it.


If you ask me,
hecaused the panic.


What a night.


Well, it was nice for you.
Your friend got engaged.


She was always engaged.


Roy said the first one
didn't count.


That's...great.


To tell you the truth, I...


used to have
a big thing for Pam.


So.


Really?
You're kidding me.


Y-you and Pam?


Wow.


I would have never...
put you two together.


You really hid it well, God!


I usually have a radar
for stuff like that.


sighs


You know,
I made out with Jan.


Yeah, I know.
Yeah, yup.


Well, Pam is cute.


Yeah.


She's really funny and--


She's warm
and she's just--


Anyway.


Well, if you like her so much,
uh, don't give up.


She's engaged.


Pfft...BFD!


Engaged ain't married.


Huh.


Never, ever, ever give up.


chuckles softly


(Dwight)
Don't worry, Michael.


I'm taking us to shore!


It's a fake wheel, dummy.


Hey, Jim?
You got a hat?


(Jim)
Yeah.


Thanks.


- laughs
- This is way too easy.


3-1. You're terrible
at this game.


- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.


- Let's go. Ready?
- Yeah.


Okay, what?
What is that?


- I don't know. 3-2.
- That's not even--no.


- You broke. 3-2.
phone ringing


Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.


- Pam! It's Michael.
Help me.


I need help right now.


- Michael, what's wrong?
- I'm hurt.


I have hurt myself.


Oh, my God!
- Okay. Wait, wait, wait.


- Oh, this is not
looking good, Pam.


- Michael, do you need me
to call an ambulance?!


- No, I want you
to pick me up.


- Okay. Wait a sec.
- What's going on?


- I thought you said
that you were hurt.


- I am hurt.
I hurt my foot.


I want to come to work,


but I need you
to come and pick me up.


on speaker phone
Oh, God!


- Hey, whoa! Michael!
- Oh, God!


- It's okay.
It's Jim.


Just say again, really loudly,
what happened.


- Okay. Buh!
I burned my foot!


Very badly,
on my Foreman Grill,


and I now need someone to
come and bring me in to work.


- You burned your foot
on a Foreman Grill?


- I enjoy
having breakfast in bed.


I like waking up
to the smell of bacon.


Sue me.


And since
I don't have a butler,


I have to do it myself.


So most nights,
before I go to bed,


I will lay six strips of bacon
out on my George Foreman Grill.


Then I go to sleep.


When I wake up,
I plug in the grill.


I go back to sleep again.


Then, I wake up to the smell
of crackling bacon.


It is delicious.
It's good for me.


It's the perfect way
to start the day.


Today I got up,
I stepped onto the grill,


and it clamped down
on my foot, that's it.


I don't see what's so hard
to believe about that.


- I've had a Foreman Grill
for about six years.


I've done about 85%
of my cooking on it,


but I've never burnt myself.


Probably because
I don't use it as a pillow.


- Pam, could you
come get me?


- Uh, I have to stay here
and answer the phone.


- Okay, could someone come
and get me, please? Ryan?


- Michael, you should
stay home and rest.


- There's no toilet paper
here.


Could Ryan--tell Ryan
to bring toilet paper!


Could you tell him that?


- Can you hop?


- I tried hopping, Kevin,


and I bumped my elbow
against the wall,


and now my elbow
has a "protruberence."


- snorts


- No one wants
to pick me up?!


- What is going on?


What is going on?


- Michael is, um, "sick,"


and he wants one of us
to rescue him.


- I'm not sick. I'm--
- I'm coming, Michael!


I'm gonna save you!
- Don't!


Is that Dwight?
I do not want Dwight.


- Hold on, Michael!
I am coming!


Wait there!
- I don't want Dwight!


- Michael, why don't you
call your girlfriend?


- I don't have a girlfriend.


- But you said you went out
with her this weekend.


- It was all made up.
Just--someone come, okay?


Anyone.
Anyone but Dwight.


car crashes


- What was that?
- What was that?


- Oh.
- Oh!


- He hit the pole.


It's broken, right? He can't--
- Oh, my gosh.


- Oh, Dwight.
Dwight.


Oh!
- Oh!


- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh.


- Is he okay?
tires screech


- He's still driving.


Dwight...


You forgot your bumper!


- Hello?


Please don't send Dwight.


upbeat music





- Morning, everyone.


Don't freak out.


I forbid anybody to freak out.


Clearly I have had
a very serious accident,


but I will recover.


God willing.


I just wanna be
treated normally today.


Normal would actually be good,


considering the trauma
that I've been through--


- You missed two big
conference calls today,


one with corporate.


- Oh, did you explain why?


- No, I didn't mention
that you cooked your foot.


- Burned my foot, Pam.


bubble wrap pops


- You should put butter on it.


- Uh, that's what she said.


See? I haven't lost
my sense of humor.


No. No need.
It was a non-stick grill.


Please stop popping my cast.


Thank you.


- So where are you
shipping your foot?


- dryly Ha ha ha.
So where are you shipping...


- Your foot.


- I always keep a stash
of bubble wrap at my house.


Some days--
hectic, tiring days--


I just like to go home
and zone out,


click on the tube,
and pop a few.


It's very soothing.


bubble wrap pops


You wanna try?


- You know, that's probably
not gonna last too long.


You should go to a hospital
and get a real cast.


- Right, like I'm gonna
spend the day in a hospital.


Ugh, bureaucracy and germs.


- And doctors.
- Yes.


So, no, thank you.
- slurs speech


- What?


- Constructing
a homemade cast--genius.


Filled with foresight.


Like in the pioneer times,
if you lost a leg,


they would then use the bone
of the leg for a cane.


They wasted nothing.


- Wow, I don't want
to hear...you talk.


Pam, could I have a word
with you in my office?


grunts


thud
I'm all right.


buzzing
Thank you.


Pam, messages, please.


- You didn't have any.
- Really?


Well, seemed very important
to you earlier,


that you needed to stay and--


- Do my job?
- No.


Your job is being
my friend, Pam, and--


Ow!
God!


- It slipped.


- What did--
- Sorry.


- It's just that before,
you said


you didn't want
any special treatment.


- I don't want
any special treatment, Pam.


I just want you to treat me
like you would a family member


who's undergone some sort
of serious physical trauma.


I don't think
that's too much to ask.


- Do you want some aspirin?


Because you seem
a little fussy.


- No, I don't want some
aspirin. Yeah, I am fussy!


Aspirin's not gonna do
a damn thing.


I'm sitting here with
a bloody stump of a foot.


- Pam, I am
assistant regional manager.


And I can take care of him.


Part of my duties are to...


- sighs


What?


Part of your duties
are to, what?


- What?


- You just said that part of
your duties are to, something.


- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.


What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with you?


- I don't want you
taking care of me.


He almost killed me in the car.


Car ride from hell.


And his car smelled of puke.


- I vomited because I crashed


on the way to pick you up
and bring you in to work.


- TMI. I don't--God.


I hope you washed your hands
before you--


- Well, I didn't.
- Hey.


- Vomit hands.
- What is wrong with you?


What is up with him?


- He seems kind of out of it.


- Like that's anything
out of the ordinary.


He just wants attention.


sighs


Oh, Pam?
- Mm-hmm?


- Would you be a dear
and get me some hot water,


that's cold water,
and an assortment of tea bags?


Thanks.


- What'd you get?


- Oh, it's nothing.


- Oh, did Roy get you an iPod.
That's cool.


- It's a Prism DuroSport.


It's not an iPod,
but it's good for athletes.


- Mm-hmm. Awesome.


- Well, you know, uh,


you know, frankly, a lot of us
have been saying


something like this
for a long time.


- Yeah, I've been saying that.
- Yeah.


And, you know, I think that


the very fact that we're
including it in our agenda,


frankly,
is a big step forward.


- Did you know
I used to be in HR?


- I'm sorry?
- I used to be in HR.


- Uh--
- I was a hellraiser.


- Okay...
- Right?!


laughs


- Great.
Um, why don't we move on?


- All right.
Moving on.


- Great, because I think that,
you know, the very fact that--


- Ryan, yeah! You're here.
What you got?


What you got?
What you got?


All right. "Panic Room,"
"Maverick," "Nell,"


"Sommersby," "The Accused."


Where's "Little Man Tate"?
- They were out.


- Aw. Come on, man.
- At three different places.


- It's not
a Jodie Foster afternoon


without "Little Man Tate,"
buddy.


sighs
All right.


Where is my cornbread?


- Here you go.
- Thank you.


Did you get all dark meat
like I like?


- Yes, I ordered three full
rotisserie chickens' worth


of all dark meat.


- Where are the yams?
- They were out of yams.


I got you creamed spinach.
- Did you go to the one


in Stroudsburg?
- Yes.


- It's the only Boston Kitchen
I trust.


- I know.
You made that very clear.


- And they had no yams?
- They had no yams.


- How strange.


Because they always have yams.


- Well, I don't know
what to tell you.


- muffled
Well...


Chicken's cold.


- Yes. Stroudsburg is
minutes away.


- You know what else is
minutes away?


Going to the Boston Kitchen
in Scranton


and then fooling around
in the parking lot.


That's--that's 45 minutes away.


Mmm! I'm telling ya,


the best cure in the world
is comfort food.


You know how they say,
"Stuff a cold"?


Well, I don't care
what you got--


the flu, Lyme disease,
emphysema--


you eat an entire
dark meat chicken,


you can walk on the moon.


- Oh, man.
Is that a Prism DuroSport?


- You've seen
one of these?


- Yeah, they're like an iPod,
only they're better,


'cause they're chunkier
and more solid.


- Roy gave it to me
for Christmas.


I'm trying to figure out
how to put songs on it.


- Oh, no, no, no.
Don't go there.


I know this Russian website


where you can download songs
for 2¢ apiece.


- Really?
- Yeah.


I'll write down the address
for you.


Only--the only thing is,


is that all the songs
are in Russian.


Kidding!


- Oh!
both laugh


- Why would they all be?


Okay.
See you later, Pan.


- "Pan"?


- Pam!


Pam?


- sighs
Oh, God.


phone ringing


- What?


- whimpering
Come here, please.


- Tell me
before I come there.


- I want you to rub butter
on my foot.


- No.
- Pam, please.


I have Country Crock.
- No.


- I'll do it!


I used to be a nurse.


- No, your hands are grizzled.


- I can be very tender,
Michael.


- gags
Come on, Pam. Please.


- No.

Ryan!


Ryan!


rattling blinds
Rya--


- sniffs
Ooh! Who made popcorn?


- These covers


are totally indestructible.


- Really?
- Yeah.


Throw it.
I promise it won't break.


Chuck it.


Oh, no.
It's broken.


- What?


- No, it's fine.


I told you it wouldn't break.


You could throw it
all day long.


- That is so cool.


Thanks, Dwight.
- Yep.


- So I guess Pam and Dwight
are friends now.


- Oh, God, no.
Dwight isn't my friend.


Oh, my God.
Dwight's kind of my friend!


- No, no. No one is
helping me out at all, Mom.


- No, I'm not gonna call Jan.


She'd just worry.


Drive down here
and make a big thing.


Who told you that?


No, it was mutual.


And what is Pam doing
chatting with you?


- Hmm.


You like candy?


- It's all right.


- 'Cause you're sweeter
than candy.


- What is wrong with you?


Hey, cut--


- Wow, you just dive right in.


- You know, around age 12,


I just started going for it,
you know?


- Help!
loud thud


groaning


Oh, help!
Help me!


- What--what happened?


- I fell off the toilet.


I'm caught between
the toilet and the wall.


- What do you need?
- Not you.


Someone else.
Get Pam.


- I don't think Pam's gonna
wanna come into the men's room.


- Get Ryan.
grunts


He needs to lift me!


And he needs to clean me up
a little bit.


Bring a wet towel.


- Ryan is, uh...dead.


- No, he's not.
I just saw him.


- No. Can you--
can you just get up yourself?


I...you only grilled your foot.


- Oh, forget it.


I'll just get up myself.


Oh! Ow!


clattering


Ow! Oh, God!


- Do you think Dwight's
being a little weird today?


- No. He's actually been
really nice and helpful.


- And that isn't weird?


- Well...


- Can I have everyone's
attention, please?


Phyllis. Oscar.


Ryan, who is supposed
to be dead.


Can I ask you all a question?


Do you know what it's like
to be disabled?


- Um, I had scoliosis
as a girl.


- Never heard of it.
No. A real disability.


Not a woman's trouble.


- When I was a teenager,
I was in an iron lung.


- Wha--how old are you?


No, it--


Look, the point is


I am the only one here


who has
a legitimate disability.


Although I'm sure
Stanley has had


his fair share of obstacles.


- I'm not disabled,
and neither are you.


- Okay, what does this
look like to you, Stanley?


- Mailboxes, etc.


- Shut it.


Okay.
Well...


Well, you know what?


Disabilities


are not things to be laughed at


or laughed about.


You people are jerks.


Imagine if you had
left Stevie Wonder


on the floor of that bathroom
instead of me.


- Oh, we wouldn't.
We love Stevie Wonder.


- sighs


I burned my foot!


Okay, 20 minutes.
Conference room.


Everybody's in there!


- Dad?


- It is so clear to me now.


They only loved me
when I was strong


and walking around.


That is so prejudiced.


What?
You gotta be kidding me.


Why are they arranged this way?


Dwight? Hello?!


Why did you do this?


And what kind of boss am I


to have raised such
an insensitive group?


sighs


I give you a little,
tiny, tiny task


and all I ask is that you--
we need leg room.


We need leg room
for people to sit.


- What are you talking about?


- This is not the luge, okay?!


I'd rather be loved
than feared.


But if I'm not loved,


at the very minimum,
I should be feared.


And if they're
not scared of me,


the least I can do is
call a big meeting


and force them all
to stop what they're doing


and to pay attention to me.


While we are waiting for
our special guest to arrive,


I wanted you all to take a look


at a few of the many,
many disabled icons


who have contributed so much
to our society.


- Quick question.
- Yeah?


- Why is Tom Hanks
on the wall?


- Twice.
- Good question.


"Forrest Gump,"
mentally challenged.


"Philadelphia," AIDS.


- I think that's from "Big."


- I don't think so, no.


- Yeah, he's dancing on a piano
with Robert Loggia.


- He grew into a man
overnight.


A rare disability.
It still works.


clicks tongue, then sighs


A crossword puzzle, Stanley?


Seriously, are you
learning nothing here?


- Mm-hmm.


- What do you mean,
"Mm-hmm"?


- I mean I'm learning nothing.
- Okay.


- Michael Scott.
I'm looking for Michael Scott.


- Yes. Right in here.
- Oh, good.


- Come on in.
- Great.


- This, ladies and gentlemen,
is our special guest.


- Sorry I'm late.


Somebody parked in
the handicapped parking space.


- Oh.


- My assignment is to make


a temporary
disabled parking permit


for Michael Scott.


- Hey, everyone.
I'm Billy Merchant.


You may have seen me
around here before.


I'm the properties manager
of this office park.


- You are so brave.


You are so brave.
- Thank you.


Actually, I've been meaning to
come by here for a long time--


- But it's hard for you, right?


Because you're in a wheelchair.


- No, I just have a lot
of properties to manage.


- Let me ask you something.


How long does it take
for you to do something simple?


Every day, like--like brush
your teeth in the morning?


- I don't know.
Like, 30 seconds.


- Oh, my God.


That's three times
as long as it takes me.


How did you
get in your wheelchair?


- This morning?


Just like every other morning.
Just climbed on in.


laughter
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!


Not funny, not funny!
- Hey, hey, relax.


Just, uh, joking around here.


- Well, that's good.


He still has a sense of humor.


- Listen, I've actually
used a chair


since I was four years old.


I don't really
notice it anymore.


- Well, they do.
They notice it.


Don't you?
You notice it.


It's the first thing you saw
when he rolled in here,


isn't it?


- I want to clamp Michael's
face in a George Foreman Grill.


- So there are just
a couple things


I wanted
to remind everybody of.


- Okay.
- First is parking.


You can't block
the freight entrance


with your car,
even if your blinkers are on.


Does anybody
have any questions?


Yes?


Yeah?


Yes?


- Dwight, you have
your hand up.


- Ignore him.


- Real question:
when we're up on the roof,


are we allowed
to bring food up there?


- No one should be on the roof.
- Oh.


- You fought for our side


in the Vietnam War.


What was that like?


- Michael, I did not fight
in Vietnam.


- You know what?


We're not that different,
you and I.


When I clamped my foot


into a non-stick--


- You know what, Michael?
- Yeah?


- Let me stop you right there.
- Okay.


- And leave.


- Did you see
"Born on the Fourth of July"?


I was under the impression


that Billy would be
more like that guy.


- And the funny thing is,


I think I had actually
convinced myself


that those meetings
couldn't get any worse.


Hey. What's up, Billy?


- What's wrong with that guy?
- You mean today?


He stepped on a George Foreman
Grill and he burned his foot.


- No, not Michael.


The moon-faced kid
who crashed into the pole.


He looks like
he has a concussion.


- Okay. Headaches.


Changes in ability
to think and concentrate.


Changes in personality.


All signs of a concussion.


- Okay, we have our diagnosis.


- Is it weird that
I like him better now


that he has a concussion?


- Look, I feel fine.


As a volunteer
sheriff's deputy,


I have been trained
to notice all the signs


of a concussion.


One of them is slurred speech,
okay?


Uh, number three,
shortness of breath.


There are four things
you have to remember.


One, I am faster
than 80% of all snakes.


Also...


bubble wrap pops


- Hey!
- Here.


I found the pudding cups
you wanted


at a gas station in Carbondale!


- You did it.
Look at you.


And with the plate
and the napkin.


Very nice.
Thank you, Ryan.


- You're very welcome.
- Did you get the yams?


- No, the gas station
in Carbondale


did not have fresh yams.


- sighs
Okay.


I'll just have the pudding.
- You sure?


- Yeah.
- Okay.


- You know what?
I feel better.


Ryan brought me
some chocolate pudding,


and his kindness
healed my foot.


Yeah, baby!


I am feelin' better.


My body's literally
healing itself.


It is amazing what
the human body is capable of


when you have a powerful brain.


- I ground up
four extra-strength aspirin


and put them
in Michael's pudding.


I do the same thing with my dog


to get him to take
his heartworm medicine.


- Oh, finally feel the blood
coursing through my foot veins.


thud
- groans


- Oh! Okay, I think
we need to take him


to the hospital, because


I'm pretty sure
he has a concussion.


- Oh, now you feel
some compassion for him.


- He needs to go
right now.


And you're
his emergency contact.


I think you should go with him.


- Why don't you go with him?


- I...barely know him.
- I want Michael to take me.


- I can't take you.
I don't have my car.


- Please?
- And yours is all vomity.


- You can take my van!


- Oh, okay.
That's great.


No, I can't drive.
Jim, why don't you drive?


- Fine.


- We'll go.
I'm still recovering.


So let's just--Ryan,
can you get my coat, please?


- Slowly. Let's just get
to the elevator.


-imitating helicopter
- What are you doing?


- Vietnam sounds.
- Stop.


Stop, stop, stop, stop.


- Tired.
- You can't lay down.


- Just take a rake--
- Wake up!


- Ah!
- Wait. Here.


Let me help you, Dwight.
- Okay, Pam.


- Get up. Get up.
- Thanks. You're the best.


- Yeah.
- Just keep him awake.


- It smells like chicken soup.
- I know.


- I have to go to the hospital.
- I know.


- Where are we going?


- I just want to say goodbye,
okay?


- I'll be back. I mean...
- Yes, I know.


But it's gonna be different.
- Why?


- It's just hard to explain.


- Oh, Pam.
You're adorable.


- Oh, my goodness.


- giggles
- Come here.


- Oh!
Huggy hugs.


- Okay. Come here.


- Okay.
- Come here.


- No, not you--no!
God, Dwight!


- Okay, I got it.
- Okay.


- Why is there a camera?
- All right. Let's go.


Get in here, for a second.
- Okay.


All right, Jim.
- All right.


All right.
- Don't puke.


Shotgun!


- You don't think
you should sit in the back


with Dwight?
- scoffs


The rules of shotgun are
very simple and very clear.


The first person
to shout "shotgun"


when you're within
the sight of the car


gets the front seat.


That's how the game's played.


There are no exceptions
for someone with a concussion.


Oh, God.
A minivan.


What is Meredith's problem?


- Well, I think she has a kid.


- Yeah, she has one kid
and no husband.


And she's not gonna find one
driving this thing around.


- Where are we going?
- All right.


Get inside.
- Where are we going?


- We're going
to Chuck E. Cheese.


- Chuck E. Cheese?
Oh, God.


I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.


- We're going to the hospital,
Michael.


- I know.
I'm just sayin'.


Dwight, what are you drinking?
- I found it under the seat.


- Oh, my God.
Dwight.


Put that down.
- I'm thirsty--no!


- Give the bottle to Michael.
- No!


- Give the bottle to Michael.
- I'm thirsty!


- Give it to me, Dwight!
- No.


- Just keep your eyes
on the road.


Give me the bottle,
or you're fired!


- You can't fire me.
I don't work in this van.


- Give it to me, Dwight!
- No.


- Give me the bottle!
- Stop. Will you stop?


- Give me the bottle, Dwight!
- Michael, stop!


- Just give it!
- Michael, stop! Stop.


- Stop it! Stop spraying!
- Ah!


- Give me the bottle!
- Stop!


- Stop spraying me!
Give me the bottle!


Dwight, what is
your middle name?


- Danger.


- Something with a "K."


- It's Kurt.


Wow, I'm so sad
that I know that.


- What do I write under
"reason for visit"?


- Concussion.


What did you write?


- clears throat
Nothing.


I wrote, "Bringing someone
to the hospital."


- So you thought
they meant your reason


for coming to the hospital.


- No, no.
You know what, Jim?


This isn't about me anymore.


I made a miraculous recovery,


which is more
than I can say for him.


- Come on, Dwight.


- sputters


Hi, Michael.
- Hi, Dwight.


- Ah.


Uh.


- Doctor, what is more serious?


A head injury,
or a foot injury?


- A head injury.


- Well, you don't have
all the information.


The foot has been
fairly severely burned,


and, uh, healed quickly.


Very quickly.


Actually, like,
suspiciously quickly.


- So I'm ordering a CAT scan.


- What is that?


- Look, since you have
the machine up and running,


can I just stick my foot in?


We can take a look.
- Well...


For a burn,
you really just need


to look at the outside
of the foot.


- Okay, what kind
of machine is that?


- Does the skin
look red and swollen?


- That's what she said.


- That's my joke.
Damn it, Dwight.


He stole my joke.
- That's very funny.


Very smart.


We need to get your friend
into the CT machine.


- Into a machine?


Okay, uh...


That's bad.
Will you stay with me?


- No.
- Okay.


Will you please
call my cousin, Mose?


- No, I'm not calling
your weirdo cousin.


years old.
Never left the beet farm.


- God...God...
- Oh, God.


- Oh, God.
- Okay!


I'll stand near you.


- Next to me?
- Next-ish.


- Okay, no electronics
past this point.


Camera, sound equipment.


- It's okay.
They're with me.


- No metal of any kind.


- All right. Well, I guess
this is where we leave you off.


- I don't wanna do this.


- Uh, well, you should have
thought of that


before you crashed your head on
your way to pick me up, so...


We'll see you when you get out.


- Oh.


- Fine. Fine.


mic turns off

- Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.


- Dunder Mifflin.
This is Jim.


- Oh, my God.
What's going on?


Is Dwight okay?
- Mm-hmm.


He should be fine,
but they brought him in


for a CAT scan.


- I can't believe
he's getting a CAT scan.


- Michael went in there
with him too.


It's pretty sweet.


- Really?
Michael went in with him?


- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.


- But they shouldn't be
much longer now,


so we'll be back soon.


- Okay, that's...good news.


- Um, uh, yeah.
No, I'll let you go.


- Okay. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.


Hey, Oscar?
- What's up, Pam?


- Um, I just wanted
to let you know


that Dwight's gonna be okay.


The doctor said there's
a really simple treatment


for a concussion,
so he'll probably even


be back at work tomorrow.


- Okay?


- I just, uh, thought
you'd wanna know that.


- Okay, Mr. Schrute.


Inhale with me on three.


One, two...


Sir, stop that.


Stop!


bugle toots


ascending tone


- What?


- Oh, nothing.


Pam's on vacation,


and she gets back tomorrow.


So it'll be nice to see her.


It'll be nice.


And, uh, she set a date


for the wedding with Roy.


Uh, June.


Summer, so that'll be nice.


And that's that.


- What?


- Oh, nothing.


- Jim's been looking at me


kind of a lot all week.


I would be creeped out by it,


but it's nothing compared


to the way Michael looks at me.


upbeat piano music





- Spamster.


- Um...


Pam, plus Spam, plus--


- Hamster.
- Right.


- Welcome back.
How was your vacation?


- It was great.
- Yeah?


- Mm-hmm.
- Did you get lucky?


Oop! Boink.


- Roy and I just got back
from the Poconos.


I get ten vacation days a year.


And I try to hold off
taking them


for as long as possible.


And this year I got to


the third week in January.


- as Sean Penn
I am Pam.


Spicoli guy.


Oh, God.


Needs numbers. Okay.


Whoa, God! Yuck, yuck, yuck.


- What?
- Yuck! Wow!


What happened in there?


- I don't know.
- There is stink in there.


My God.


What is--what is that?


- Oh, I don't know.
- Is that a bird?


- No, I don't think
it's a bird.


- Oh, God.


How could that happen?
How could--


right in the middle
of the carpet.


- What's going on?
- Um, somebody vomited


right in the middle
of the carpet in my office.


- I don't think that's vomit.


- Check it out.


- Me?
- Check it out.


Don't be a wuss. Just get--


no, I'm not
holding your coffee.


Tell me what it is.
- Oh, that's a real bitch.


- What is it?


- Michael.
- What is it?


knocking on door
No, just tell me what it is.


- Michael, I--I--I gotta
get outta here.


I can't hold my breath
that long.


knocking on door


- Open the door up.
- gasping


knocking on door


- If he's not gonna
tell me what it is,


I'm gonna leave him in there.
- I don't know what it is!


- Oh, stop crying.


- It smelled terrible.


- inhales deeply


- Ugh!
- Phew!


- Oh, no. Mm-mm, mm-mm.


- clears throat
I cannot believe


a pipe burst
and left that there.


- That's no burst pipe.


- How do you know that?
What is it then?


- Maybe it's, um,
like, roadkill.


- There's a slight
discoloration


that runs throughout it.
- Maybe it was a flood


and then the water receded
and left--


- Or maybe it grew.


- What?
- Yes, with enough


light and water,
anything can grow.


- It didn't grow.
- Oh, man.


- Oh, it's really gross.


- Yeah, thank you,
Captain Obvious.


- That's odd.


From this angle,


it looks completely different.


- Hey, guys.


Somebody making soup?


- Here she comes.


All cleaned? Great.


- gags
Still stinky.


- That is worse.


- She probably scrubbed it


into the fibers of the carpet.


Total permeation.


- I am a big
"Fear Factor" fan.


Um, I'm a big fan of anything


Joe Rogan does, actually.


So this is sort of like
my audition tape.


Um... clears throat


shudders


I can't stand it.


I can't stay in here
another second.


door closes
- Hey.


Welcome back.
- Thanks.


- So how was the resort?


Did you ski a lot?
- A little.


- Good.
loud bang


What's going on in here?


What?


I did not do that.


That sounds disgusting.


- laughing
It wasn't me.


Um... it wasn't me.


It was not me.


Oh.


Wow.


- chuckles


- Hey, Jim, I thought


that we would be desk buddies


while they change my carpet.


That might be
a little difficult


with the one computer.


- Oh.


- But there's definitely
a desk open in the back.


- Yeah.


- Which I guess I'll be taking.


- No, no, no, seriously,
I don't mind sharing.


- No, no, no, seriously.


I'll be in the back.


Hey, Kelly.


- Are you moving
back here?


- Um, just for the day


while Michael's at my desk.


- Because Toby
used to sit there.


But then he had
to move over there


because of an allergy.


- Allergy to... the desk?


- Weird.


- Yeah, yeah, yeah.


- exhales
- Ol' bullpen.


- chuckles
The ol' bullpen.


- Don't hate me.


- Okay.


- This is great.


- Yeah.


- The pressures of my office


are insane.
- Mm.


- I just--
you couldn't understand.


But, man, you guys have it
easy out here.


You know I used to sit
right here?


- No way.
- Yeah.


- And who had your office?


- Ed Truck.


Yuck.


Ed Truck was the manager
before me.


Horrible. He hated fun.


It was like, "Oh, Ed Truck
is walking toward us.


"Stop having fun.


Start pretending to do work."


What a jerk. He's--


you know what?


I swore to myself
that if I ever got


to walk around the room
as manager,


people would laugh
when they saw me coming


and would applaud
as I walked away.


- I'm serious, my closet doors


will not shut.


I mean, it only takes so long


to measure to make sure
that clothes will hang up.


'Cause aren't all hangers,
like, that big?


So I don't understand


why the closet engineer
didn't think of that.


So now,
I'm doing this new thing


where I just leave piles
of clothes on the floor.


And I walk around the piles
to get an outfit.


- You know who used
to sit at that desk?


- That guy Miles, who quit
to form his own company?


- Mm-mm. Todd Packer.


- No, I thought he was
out on the road.


He was, but, uh...


that desk was empty.


He'd come in and sit
there sometimes.


- Ah.


- When I was in training,


many years ago,
not so long ago,


I worked side by side


with a fellow
named Todd Packer.


And together,
we rocked the office.


clattering


Packer and I
once spent a whole day


with our pants off.


And when people noticed,
we convinced them


that they were crazy.


I would gladly pay you Tuesday


for a hamburger today.


- Excuse me one second,
please.


What is it that you need
right now that can't wait


until I'm off the phone
with a customer?


- Ooh, a customer.


Well, sound the alarm.


laughs Okay.


Another time,
Packer held this guy's head


in the toilet
for, like, a minute.


Guy had no sense
of humor about it.


Probably why he wasn't hired.


grunts Oh!


- What did you hit me for?


- Oh, Charlie horse.


- What?
- Charlie horse!


- You shouldn't have hit me,
Michael.


- Okay, gah.


Once, as a joke,


Packer banged
every chick in the office.


It was hysterical.


- That looks cool.
Where is that?


- What?
- That hotel?


It looks so romantic.


- Oh, uh, just somewhere
in the Poconos.


I was just surfing.


- I went with my parents


to the ShadowBrook Farm once.


That was also really romantic.


Oh, my God, I wish a boy
would take me there.


I would need a fun new top.


You know what
a great color is on me?


Lavender, actually.
- 'Scuse me one second.


I'm just gonna
grab something to eat.


Hey.
- Hey.


- So you used to share
that cubicle with Kelly, right?


- Mm-hmm.


- And then you just
changed desks, right?


- Yeah.


- To one without a cubicle.


- Yeah.
- Hm.


So you just couldn't
take it anymore, huh?


- What are you talking about?


- So that's how it's gonna be.


- quietly Yeah.


Honestly,


I don't even hear her anymore.


It's like waves crashing
against the beach.


- Beyoncé,


pink, the color,


Pink, the person,


hot dogs,


basically anything
that is awesome,


snow cones--
- Hey, Jim.


Michael wanted me to ask you


how to raise your desk chair.


- It's the lever on the side.


- That's what I told him.


Thanks.


- Oh, my God, he is so cute.


Would you talk to him for me


and see if he likes me?


- Oh, no, I don't think I can--


- Oh, please, Jim.
Please, please, Jim.


Please, please, please?
He's so cute.


I like him so much.


And I would do it,
but I'm too shy.


Please, Jim?
Please, please, please?


Please, Jim, please?
Please, please?


- whispers
Dwight.


- whispers
Michael.


- Let's send up accounting.


- What?
- Old-fashioned raid.


Sales on accounting.


- laughs softly


- Follow my lead.


Hey, guys.
- Hey, Michael.


- What's up?
- Hey, Dwight.


both screaming and laughing


- Whoo-hoo!


- Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!


Woo!


- Ah! Ah!
- Sales rules!


Yeah, yeah!


laughs


- Should we help 'em
pick up their stuff?


- No, no, no, no.
We don't do that.


We don't do that.
- Oh, okay.


Watch out, Pam.


You're next.


- You're gonna throw
my things on the ground?


- Maybe.


- What happened
in Michael's office was wrong.


I understand it.


It makes sense.


laughs


But it's--but it was
still wrong.


- Obviously, this was Kevin.


This is his sense of humor
exactly.


- There are so many people
with motives.


Even me.


Almost everyone is a suspect.


chuckles


Whoever did this is a genius.
laughs


- I can't imagine
anybody in the office


hates Michael that much.


Well, maybe.


- I think this whole disaster
on Michael's carpet


happened for a good reason.


Him sitting next to me
is a huge gift.


This girl I know


would say that it
was a gift from God,


but I don't know
about all that.


Why would somebody ruin


a perfectly good carpet?


I don't know.


Could be done out of hate.


Could be done out of love.


It could be completely neutral.


Maybe somebody hates
the cleaning lady.


And, well, she doesn't do
a very good job, obviously.


because my office still reeks


like you would not believe.


I hate her. scoffs


- You know what?
I am beginning to think


that what happened to my carpet


was an act of terrorism
against the office.


The only thing
that makes any sense.


- Hello,
am I the 107th caller?


Hello, Rock 107,


am I the 107th caller?


Hello, Rock 107,
am I the 107th caller?


I'm totally gonna win us
that box set.


- Stop.


- Jethro Tull--
- Stop it.


Stop. It.


Don't.


Don't.


- I need to make
a sales call.


Please?


- All right.


- whispering
Am I the 107th caller?


- quietly That's so smart.


- quietly
Leave it all packed.


We can go in a
couple of weeks, maybe.


- Yeah, right.
- Okay, maybe not.


- Like, maybe for, like,
President's Day or something.


- Yeah, that's right.


We could do
a three-day weekend.


I wonder if I could, like,
call in sick on Friday.


And then get
a four-day weekend.


laughs


- It's so hard to fall asleep.
And I just hate it, cause I try


to go to bed at, like,
9:30 every night.


- Are you kidding?
- No.


- Hi, guys.


- We haven't finished
getting things


in order from your last visit.


- I'm just walking around.


- Were you?
- Well, yeah.


- It's just that we're really
swamped over here, Michael.


- Oh, and I'm not?
Why would you say that?


Because I'm having fun?


You guys just are


working for the weekend,
aren't you?


I'm working for the week.


Sales team.


Listen to me.


This is what we're gonna do.


I'm gonna up the ante
a little bit, literally.


Right here, I'm going
to put a crisp $100 bill.


The person with the most sales


at the end of the day
gets to keep the cash.


Sound good?
- Yeah!


- 70, 80, 1, 2, 3.


$83. Still a lot of money.


And I'm going to...


I'm gonna leave it
right over here


where everybody can see it.


I will be taking
Jim's clients today


because he is not here.


And out of sight,
out of the contest.


Let's see who winds up
with the cash, shall we?


- You're gonna compete
against us?


- Oh, it is on, Phyllis!
It is so on!


- It is so on!


- God, this is gonna be fun.


- Michael is gonna
wipe the floor with us.


- So you have 40 boxes
going out.


And I will deliver those
personally in a Sebring.


Very good.
Nice doing business with you.


Thank you.


Yes!


chuckles Yeah.


Read it and weep.


Oh. Ooh, look at that.


Look at me, Phyllis.
Oh, what is that?


That's my sale.


humming tune


vocalizing


- What--what's that?
What you doing?


- Nothing.
- I think he's dancing.


- No, just--


- That was definitely
not dancing.


- You know what, guys?
It's none of your concern.


It was official business,
so just--


- Paper business.
- Yeah, paper business.


Is this done?
- No.


"Extreme Home Makeover"


puts together a house
in an hour.


If you were on that crew,


you'd be fired like that.


- Somebody did something bad


to Michael's carpet.


Maybe that's all
we need to know.

- chuckling


- Ah!


- You gotta drink.
I'm not letting you get back.


You ready?
- Mm-hmm.


thumping
- Uh-huh,


now you got to drink.
- Ah.


- All right, three boxes.
Excellent.


Oh, hey, I can't offer you
a discount right now,


but for the same low price,


you could put in
next month's order


right now as well.


Okay, six it is. Fantastic.


Good. No, thank you.


Bye-bye.


- Okay, that quantity
of cotton fiber


will cost you...


my screen disappeared.


I know.
Uh, I will click on the bottom


and, yes, I'm getting
one of those


little hourglass things.


Used to have a price chart
on the wall.


Now it's a little
hourglass thing with a


arrow next to it.


Now it's just an hourglass
thing.


Uh-huh, yeah, well,
or I can call you back.


Okay.


- Excellent, good, good.


Well, our truck is going out


first thing
tomorrow morning, so...


- 45 cases of technical format
coded white paper.


Okay, thanks again so much.


All righty, buh-bye.


- 20 cartons of it's coming.
On its way.


- What's going on?
Anything here?


- Yes.
- Yes?


Yes, what?
Yes, a sale or a lead or--


- A sale.
- Ah.


Small?
- Big.


- Huge?
- Just big.


- Would you say the sale
that I made earlier,


it was huge or--
- Big.


- Good, no,
I completely understand.


Times are a little tight
right now.


If it's all right
with you, though,


I will just give you
a call back next month.


Great.


Thank youso much. Goodbye.


- What was that?


- What?
- You call that a sales call?


My God, what have
they been teaching you?


- You're the one
who trained me, Michael.


- Yeah, well, did I teach you


to roll over
like a submissive dog?


- You most certainly did not.
- No, I did not.


- What can I do better?
- Exactly, ask me.


which you did, so--


tell a joke.


- I'm not good at jokes.


- Do you know a joke?


- My cousin Mose
told me a joke.


- Call a client right now.
- Okay.


- And tell them the joke.


- I will.


- Strike while the iron's hot.


The joke always works.


- Yes, Howard Gruber, please.
- Just sell it.


- Howard, hello.
Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.


Yes, and you are
my favorite client.


chuckles
Listen, I'm calling you


to tell you a little joke.


What is black and white
and red and can't think?


A nun who has
a beet for a head.


uncomfortable laughter


No, I--I'm Catholic, too.


- Give me the phone.


- I understand.
- Give me the phone.


- If I was offensive
in any way--


- Tell them that your
supervisor is on the line.


- Humor is--works in--
- The old one-two.


- crazy ways. I'm gonna pass
you off to my supervisor.


Hold on one second.


Howard Gruber, it's Howard.
- Hey, Howard.


Michael Scott here.


Yeah, sorry about that.


Dwight is an idiot.


I know. No, he's a little...


little dim.


He's the janitor's brother,
so...


- That's not true.


- Uh-huh.


Yeah, well, you know, like,


at a fast food restaurant,


just to be nice,
you'll hire somebody


who can't even find
their way to work?


That is Dwight.


- whispers
He's my best customer!


- What can we do
to help you out?


You know what?
I have a discount,


today and today only,
on lightweight copier paper.


- No, that's my sale.


This is--this is my sale!


Michael!
- Uh-huh.


Yes, I can do that.


Absolutely!


Perfect. Oh, I'm glad
it timed out that way.


- What Michael
doesn't understand


is that when I worked
in the fast food industry,


I was actually commended
by management


for the three M's.


McService,


McCompetence,


and McPunctuality.


- Who do you think did it?


- Are you kidding?
I thought it was you.


- Really? I thought you.


both chuckle


- This was no act of God.
A person did this.


A person who works
in this office.


Maybe all of them.


You know what?


Today is not a good day


for a sales contest.


We're--we're not
doing this today.


- That doesn't seem fair.


- You want to talk
about fair?


Does anyone need to smell
my old carpet?


You explain to me
how that was fair,


and I'll explain to you
how this is fair.


Plus I just--I think
that picking today


was sort of taking advantage.


- But you're the one
who picked today.


- I am a victim
of a hate crime.


Stanley knows
what I'm talking about.


- That's not what
a hate crime is.


- Well, I hated it
a lot, okay?


I-- You know what?


If the guilty person
would just come forward


and take their punishment,
we'd be done.


Very well.


Then you're all punished.


- What's our punishment?


- You're all on a time-out.


Just sit there quietly.


phone ringing


No, no.


phone ringing


- Hey.


- What's up?
- Nothing much.


Let me ask you something.


It's actually a little awkward.


- What?


- What do you think of Kelly?


- I don't know.


Depends if you like
a little junk in...


um, she's really cool.


- Are you interested in her?


- Yeah, totally.


- Really?
- Did she say something?


- She said lots of things.


- Do you know
if she's looking for


a long-term thing


or if she'd be cool
just hanging out?


- I have no idea.


- Could you find out?


- Yeah.


Sure.


- I don't know much
about Kelly.


But why not? Try it out.


It's not like I'm gonna
be here that long.


And she's really cute.


Right?


- Oh, long-term, definitely.


Fall in love, have babies,


spend every second together.


But don't tell him that, okay?


Just tell him
I'm, like, up for anything.


I mean, I'm not a slut,
but who knows?


- Do you remember Ed Truck?


- Sure, he hired me.


How's he doing?


- How would I know?


- I thought you might.


- My biggest fear is
turning into him.


- Michael, you should have
much bigger fears than that.


- sighs


I wasn't talking
literally, Creed.


Yeah, being buried alive
would be worse.


Happy? Why am I talking to you?


Ed?


Hi, thanks for meeting me.


Must be kinda neat coming back.


- Yeah. Shall we go upstairs?


- Uh, well, honestly, Ed,


I really don't want
to be up there right now.


- So what's the problem
with my pension?


- Oh, no, no, no.


You're good, it was clerical.
You're good.


Um, what does that
smell like to you?


- I have a cold.


- For God's sake.


- What does that
smell like to you?


- Well, somebody


did something in my office,


and I now think that
they did it on purpose


and it was directed at me.


- But what was done?
- I don't know.


I didn't get a good look at it.


But it smells horrible.


- Whoa. sniffs


- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.


- Yeah, somebody once


did that in my office.
- Really?


- Yeah.
- Well, that figures.


So how did you deal with


people not liking you?


- Well, some people liked me.


- Can I be frank?


- You should say that


before you speak frankly.


- You had no idea


that people hated you so much?


That amazes me.


- I was their boss.


- Yeah, well--
- Now you're their boss.


You can't expect to be
friends with everybody.


- Well, sure I can.


- No.
They'll always think of you


as a boss first.
- Not necessarily.


You can love a boss
like you do a father.


- I'm not sure
that ever happens.


- Well, okay.


Different management styles.


- Why can't your workers
be your workers,


family be your family,
your friends be your friends?


- Okay, yeah,
sounds like a good idea.


- The best thing you can do
for your workers


is give them a strong,
stable company to work at.


- Ah.
- That's what helps them


with their real friends


and their real family.


- Last week,
I would've given a kidney


to anyone in this office.


I would've reached


right into my stomach
and pulled it out for them.


But now, no.


I don't have the relationship


with these people
that I thought I did.


I hope they ask.


So they can hear me say,


"Uh, no.


"I only give my organs
to my real friends.


Go get yourself
a monkey kidney."


- Hey, Brenda, this is,


uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.


And I got your number
from the corporate directory.


And, well,
I was assuming that you


probably gave it
to them because


you wanted me
to ask you out, right?


Um, so give me a call back.


You can get my number
from said directory,


um, or just check your email


cause I just sent you one.


Yikes.
Uh, give me a call back...


I hope.


I'll talk to you later. Bye.


- You just asked a girl out
on the phone.


- Yup.


- Okay, look, I know
what you're gonna say.


That I'm not standing up
for myself.


But you know what?
It's complicated


and I really don't appreciate
all the badgering.


- You could out-sell Michael
any day.


phone rings


- Yes.


- Hello, yes,
I'm looking for a gay nerd


named Michael Scott.
- Who is this?


How did you get this number?


- Your mom, you gay nerd.


- Oh, my God.


Packer. Packster!


Wacky Pack, how you doing?


- Hey, listen, did you
get that package


I left for you?


- Uh, no.


Did anybody see
a package here today?


No, how big was it?


- It was pretty big.


- Really?
- Yeah.


- You see a big package?


Where did you leave it?


- Left it in the middle
of your office.


- Really? Guys, did you see


a big package in my office?


- You mean the thing?


- laughing


- Are you kidding me?


Oh.


- Special delivery.
- That was Packer!


Oh, you're--oh, you are dead.


You are dead, my friend.


That is hilar--Oh, God!


Of course it was you.


- Sit on the throne, Michael.
- Oh, yeah, yeah!


Oh, my God, it was Packer.


It takes
an advanced sense of humor.


I don't expect everybody
to understand.


It was done out of love
just like I thought.


It's, uh, God,
these people are so--


these are good people.


We have fun. We just have fun.


Oh, I'm just so sorry
that I threw the thing out.


- We're all done.
- Yes, my office!


See ya later, peasants.


- sighs


What was that look?


- I didn't give a look.


What was your look?


- I don't know
what you're talking about.


- We should've guessed Packer.


- I still thought you did it.


Even after you denied it.


- I still thought it was you.
- chuckles


- You have seven
unheard messages.


beep
- Hey, Jim, it's Pam.


I keep looking up
to say something to you,


and then Michael's there
and it's horrible.


Anyway, I'm bored.


Come back.


beep
Hey, guess what?


I moved my computer
so I can't see Michael's head.


It's working.
I think I can have a career


as a very specific type
of decorator.


beep
Sudoku.


Level, moderate.
Time, 18 minutes.


Suck on that, Halpert.


beep
I'll transfer you.


Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.


Hold, please.


Dunder Mifflin, this is--
Okay, sorry.


Michael was standing
at my desk


and I needed to be busy
or who knows what


would've happened,
so thank you.


beep
Hey, what's that word


we made up for when you have


a thing stuck in your shoe?


Anyway, I have a thing
stuck in my shoe.


beep
Hey, I have a chance


to sneak out of here early,


and I'm not messing this up,


so I'll see you tomorrow.


beep
Calling from my cell phone.


I don't know
if you guys figured out


who did that
to Michael's carpet yet,


but I have a theory
that involves


an interdepartmental
conspiracy--


everybody in the office.


We need to talk.


- Nothing much.
What's up with you?


- I cannot believe
I feel for that.


laughs
Gosh.


- Ha ha.
What?


What?
Where's the funny?


Give it to me.


- Um, is it me, or does it
smell like updog in here?


- What's updog?


- Nothing much.
What's up with you?


- Oh, wow.


laughs
I walked right into that.


Oh, that's brilliant.


Hey, Stanley.
Is that jacket made of updog?


- I'm on the phone.


indistinct chatter


- Mm!


What flavor coffee
is that, updog?


- What's that?


- I don't know.
Nothing.


What's up with you?


- Huh?
- No.


Damn it.


- What does that mean?


- What does what mean?
- That thing you just said.


- Just forget it.


Dwight.


Hey, is it me,


or does this place
smell like updog?


- What's updog?
- Gotcha!


laughs
Oh, God!


Crap.


Nothing.
How are you doing?


- Good.
How are you doing?


- Mm, I can't.


sighs
Damn it.

- whistling melody


- Really, just the two?
You think that'll be enough?


- No, I don't.


whistling melody


- Smart.


- whistling melody
Spring cleaning!


whistling melody


- Sad.
- What?


- Smart.
- Yeah.


- Today is spring cleaning day
here at Dunder Mifflin,


and, yes, I know it's January.
I am not an idiot.


But if you do
your spring cleaning


in January, guess what
you don't have to do


in the spring.


Anything.


They say a cluttered desk
means a cluttered mind.


Well, I say
an empty desk means an--


- Empty mind.
- No.


That's not--no.


That's not
what I was gonna say.


Look at 'em all out there.


My little worker bees
buzzing away.


- If they're the worker bees,
you're the queen bee.


- No, I am the king bee.


- Queen's higher.
- No, king is higher.


Then ace.


I am the ace bee.


- Meredith, men's room.


Make sure you replace
the urinal cakes.


They're worn down.


Kevin, file drawers.


Angela, kitchen.


Oscar, dusting.
Where is Oscar?


- He's out sick.


- That is unacceptable.


- I agree.
It's unacceptable.


- What are you guys doing?


- "People" magazine
crossword puzzle,


keep or toss?


- Keep.
I will finish that later.


- It's from '99.


- Yeah, I know
when it's from, Ryan.


- 18 across--
Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.


Michael wrote, "Judd?"


- Michael.
- Yes.


whispers
Oscar is out sick.


- On a Friday?


Sick on a Friday.
Starting the weekend early.


Homey, don't play that.


Man, this is a huge problem
in offices everywhere.


I looked this up,
and it turns out


that two
out of every five sick days


are taken on a Friday
or a Monday.


Think about that.


dialing


line trilling


- Can I do some of the talking?
- I will do the talking.


- Okay, let him know
that I'm here though.


- Hello?


- What difference does it make
whether you're here?


- Hello?


- Hi, Oscar.
It's Michael.


- And Dwight.


- Yeah, um, heard you
were under the weather.


- Yeah, I think
I came down with the flu.


- Really?
Oh, that is a shame.


You know,
it's cleaning day here today.


Could've used some of that
famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.


- Yeah, I feel terrible
about it.


- Ask him his symptoms.
I'm on WebMD.


- What are your symptoms?


- I have the chills...
- Mm-hmm.


- I'm feeling nauseous,
and my head's killing.


- sighs
Checks out.


- Michael, is there anything
you need from me?


I'd like to go back to bed.


- I need you to go to bed.
I need you to get better.


See you Monday
unless you're still sick.


So have a great long weekend.


- I'll just be sleep--


- Okay, first impressions.
- He sounded sick.


- Which is exactly
how you'd want to sound


if you wanted someone
to think you were sick.


- That's exactly
what I was thinking.


- Question, may I investigate?


- Yeah, drop what you're doing.


Make this a priority
because an office


can't function efficiently
unless people


are at their desks
doing their jobs.


- I bought my veil.
- Oh, my God.


That is so exciting.
Can I be a bridesmaid?


- Um...


- Listen,
you don't have to answer now,


but how are you
gonna do your hair?


- Okay, I was thinking
about wearing it down


kind of, like, I don't know.
Like, loose with big curls.


- You look like an angel.
I'm seriously gonna cry.


- Wowie.
Mikey likey.


Why don't you wear your hair
like that all the time?


It's much sexier.


sighs


Man, this must be
torture for you.


- Yeah, on the booze cruise,


I told Michael
about some feelings


I used to have for Pam.


I had just broken up
with Katie


and had a couple of drinks,


and I confided
in the world's worst confidant.


Hey, Mike.
- Hey, Jim bag.


- Remember that thing
I told you


on the booze cruise about Pam?


That was personal,


so if we could just keep
that between you and me,


that would be great.
- Really?


- Mm-hmm.
- Who else knows?


- Nobody.
- Wow.


Jim and I are great friends.


We hang out a ton--
mostly at work.


But the fact that he told me
his secret and no one else


says everything
about our friendship,


and it is why I intend
on keeping that secret


for as long as I possibly can.


My lips are sealed.
My lips are sealed


Bangles.
- All right, great.


Thank you.


- Can you hear me?


They talk about us


Telling lies


- Listen, temp, I am conducting
a little investigation,


so I am no longer gonna be able
to head up spring cleaning.


Do you think you
can handle it?


- Yeah, I think
I can handle it.


- Do you think or do you know?


- I think.


- Oh, God.
Here.


- Don't be fooled
by the phrase "dust bunnies."


They are
vicious, little bitches,


and if they get inside
your disc drive, God help you.


They will bring your computer
to its knees.


They sit in corners


hatching,
defecating, laying eggs,


and their sole purpose in life
is to eat dead skin,


which humans in this office
shed by the boatload.


Especially Creed.


- Hey, what you getting?
- I'm going with grape.


Ah, good stuff.
Good stuff.


- Yup.


- See the game last night?
- Which game?


- Any of 'em.


So, uh, what's the 4-1-1?


Any updates
on the "P" situation?


- I don't know what you mean.


- P-A-M.
- Yeah, no.


- P-A...
- Oh.


- M.
- Okay.


- No, it's okay.
We're talking code.


- What?
What is?


- Listen, Stan--you know,


how long does it take
for you to pick out a soda?


- I'm gonna take off actually.


- All right, well...
- Yep.


- Cool.


Still deciding?
- Hm?


- Peach iced tea.


You're gonna hate it.


- Hey, Oscar, how you doing?
Dwight Schrute calling.


Listen, little question
for you, buddy.


I called six minutes ago,
and no one answered,


so I was wondering
if you could expl--


Oh, I see.


So sounds like you're too sick
to come into work,


but you're well enough
to go to the pharmacy.


There are several
different ways


to tell if a perp is lying.


The liar
will avoid direct eye contact.


The liar will cover part of
his or her face with his hand,


especially the mouth.


The liar will perspire.


Unfortunately, I spoke
to Oscar on the phone,


so none of this is useful.


- It's grrrape...soda.


- Tony the Tiger.
- Yeah.


- You don't hear that
much anymore.


- Not so much.


- Okay,
what is going on here?


- Nothing.
- Oh, really, nothing?


Fact,
you are drinking grape soda.


You never drink grape soda.


Fact, you are talking to Jim.
You never talk to Jim.


- Fact, I love grape soda.
I always have.


Fact, Jim and I talk
all the time.


We tell each other secrets.


- Okay, so what is the secret,
Michael?


- Um, I had asked Michael


if I could head up
the Oscar investigation,


and he said that only Dwight
was capable of handling


such sensitive material.


- Is that true?


- Um...


I--I don't know.


Uh...yeah, yeah, it is.


- Thank you, Michael.


I know
you're telling the truth.


- Okay.
- I can tell.


I won't let you down.


- Good.
- Thanks.


- exhales deeply
Nice, that was--that was slick.


What're you doing for lunch?
- I don't know.


I'm probably just gonna eat
my ham and cheese sandwich


in the break room.
- Oh, nonsense.


No way, no.


Why don't, uh...


why don't I take you
out to lunch?


My treat.
- Uh, no.


That's all right.
Thank you though.


It's--I gotta do some cleaning.


I should probably
stick around here.


- Hey, know what we could do?


We spread out a blanket
in the break room,


have a little picnic,
order some 'za.


Talk about you know who.


- Oh, um, nope.
You know what?


- The P to the A to the M.
- Let's go out.


That was a good idea.
Let's go out.


- I know just the place.


upbeat music


Oh, man,
you should order milk.


Get it?


Why do I like Hooters?


Well, I will give you
two reasons.


The boobs and the hot wings.
chuckles


- Oh, here we go.
Here we go.


Bogey at three o'clock.
Hi.


- Hey, I'm Dana.
Welcome to Hooters.


- We're not worthy.
We're not worthy.


Hello, Dana.


I am Michael,
and this is Jim,


and we are brothers.


- Nope.
We're not brothers.


- Well, we're
old fraternity brothers, so...


- Oh, what frat?


upbeat music


- Yeah, I rushed
a few fraternities,


but you know what?


I don't believe
in paying for friendships,


so I made a decision
not to accept any offers,


and, fortunately,
none were made,


which was good,
so nobody's feelings got hurt.


laughs
Just kidding.


I'm just making it up.


I'm his boss, actually,
and I treat him well.


I'm taking him out to lunch
because I can afford it,


and he can have
whatever he wants.


- Can I just have
the ham and cheese sandwich?


- Great.
- Thanks.


- And for you?


- Tell me, Dana,
how is your chicken breast?


- Oh, it's great.


It's served with
our world-famous wing sauce.


- Mmm, sounds yummy.
I will have a chicken breast.


Hold the chicken.


- groans
- chuckles


- Is that what you really want?





- No, I'm gonna have
the gourmet hotdog.


- Great.





- Who took all the black ones?
- That's a communal bowl.


- So how did Oscar sound
when he called in?


- Sick.
Like, lots of sniffling.


I don't know.
- Sniffling how?


- Um, how many different ways
are there to sniffle?


- Three.


- Okay, it was the second one.


- Okay, good.
Thank you.


That wasn't so hard,
now, was it?


- Mm-mm.


- What do you like best
about Pam?


- Oh, I really
don't wanna talk about it.


- Her legs or boobs, or...?


- Um, she's easy
to talk to, I guess,


and, uh, she's got
a really good sense of humor.


- Really?
- Mm-hmm.


- Never gets
any of my jokes.


- What about you?
- Her boobs definitely.


- Wow, that's not what I meant.


- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.


- And I understand
we have a birthday today.


- Oh, happy birthday, Jim!


- Ready, girls?
Front side!


all:
You put your front side in


You put your front side out


You put your front side in


And you shake it all about
- Wow.


all: You do the hokey-pokey
and you turn yourself around


That's what it's all about


- Thank you.
- Whoo, yeah!


- Thanks.
Thanks, Dana.


- Thank you very much!


- clears throat


- Temp, shouldn't you
be monitoring the progress


of people's cleaning efforts?


- Everything seems
pretty much under control.


- Yeah, well, I'd hate
to see it blow up in your face.


- How would--
- Let's table that.


So, temp, you seem
to be pretty close


to this Oscar.


- Not really.
- Getting defensive?


- No.
- You seem a little nervous.


You shouldn't be.


- Thank you, Dana.
- Sure.


- Keep the change.
Here you go, buddy.


Happy birthday.
- Wow, thanks.


- You're welcome.
- No, you know what?


Seriously, you should have it.
- No, no, no, no, no.


I have the long sleeve.


And, actually,
you know what we should do?


We should wear 'em
tomorrow to work.


It'd be hysterical.
chuckles


- Ooh, tomorrow.


Uh, that's gonna be tough


'cause I already
laid out my outfit, so...


- Okay, Tuesday.
Whenever.


You better try it on,
make sure it fits.


- Okay.


Lunch with Michael was...


Not terrible.


Oh, that's hilarious.
Hey.


- What did you guys talk about?


Just, you know,
politics, literature.


- I hate you.


- Quick Oscar update.


I have conducted interviews
with everyone in the office--


- Just go to his house
and see if he's sick.


I could've done
this investigation


in, like, 20 minutes.
- Including prep time?


- Just do it.


- If I had to,


I could clean out my desk
in five seconds


and nobody would ever know
I had ever been here.


And I'd forget too.


- Expense this.
- Michael, is that a wig?


- No, it's--
I wear it like that sometimes.


Is that a wig?
- This is from Hooters.


- Yeah, it was
a business lunch.


- Did Toby approve this?
- No, he did not.


I don't need his permission.


- You just got your
corporate credit card back.


Do you really want me
to take it away again?


- groans
It's ridiculous.


They took my card away


because I spent 80 bucks
at a magic shop.


What they don't understand
is that I bought the stuff


to impress potential clients,
so business related, right?


I put a cigarette
through a freaking quarter,


and you know what, Toby?
They almost bought from us.


- I'm not processing this.


- Look, Jim needed
a relaxing lunch.


He has been depressed,


and it has been
affecting his productivity.


How is that not work related?
- He seems fine to me.


- You're not his friend.
You don't know.


He is in love with a girl
he works with who's engaged,


so just cut me
some slack please.


- Pam?


- Hey, Angela,
who would you choose,


Jim or Roy?


- It's nobody's business,
Phyllis.


Roy.


- Jim has got it bad for Pam.


- chuckles
Which one is Pam?


- Well, she's the--


hey, Michael.
- Hm?


- So do you think Jim will try
to break up the wedding?


- You know what, Kevin?


Jim is a friend of mine,


so the only people
that this crush really concerns


is Jim and Pam and me.


- As a volunteer
sheriff's deputy,


I've been doing surveillance
for years.


One time,


I suspected an ex-girlfriend
of mine of cheating on me,


so I tailed her
for six nights straight.


Turns out she was


with a couple of guys,
actually, so...


Mystery solved.


- Jim, why didn't you tell me
that you had a crush on Pam?


- Well, the cat's
out of the bag.


I used to have a crush on Pam,


and now I don't.


Riveting.


- Yeah.
- No, it's not.


- Nice.


She is so hot.


- Hey.
- Hey.


- Did you find anything good
in your desk?


- Uh, coupon
for a free sandwich.


- Score.
- Expired in August.


And my cell phone charger
from two years ago.


- Big day.
- Big day.


Hey, uh, listen.


Um...


I told Michael
on the booze cruise--


so stupid.


Um...


I told Michael that I
had had a crush on you


when you first started here.
- Oh.


- Well, I just thought that--


I figured you should
hear it from me...


rather than--
I mean, you know Michael.


- Right.


- And...seriously,


it's totally not a big deal.
Okay?


And when I found out
that you were engaged, I mean--


- No, I--I know.
- It was like--


- Like, I kind of--
like, I--


I thought that maybe you did
when I first started.


- Oh, you did?


- No, I mean, just 'cause we,
like, got along so well.


- No, yeah, no, yeah.


You saw through me.
Great.


both chuckle


- So are you gonna be, like,
totally awkward around me now?


- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- laughs


- Hope that's okay.
- Mm-hmm.


- And Pam.


It was, like,
three years ago,


so I am totally over it.


- Cool.
- Okay.


- whispering
Stay low.


It's him.


This is it.
There he is.


He's been gone
for at least two--


who is that?


Come to Papa.


chuckles


- I got those.


- Oh, yes.


Let's roll.
engine rumbles


I knew it!


Oh, man, you are so busted!


Ice skates?
Shopping bags?


I think I know
what's going on here.


You weren't sick at all.
- Who's this?


- This is Dwight Schrute.
Who is this?


- Gil.


- Are you going
to tell Michael?


- How about this?


I don't tell Michael,
and, in exchange,


you owe me
one great, big, giant favor


redeemable by me at a time
and place of my choosing.


Guess what I found out
about Oscar tonight.


He was lying about being sick.


Should I have reported
Oscar's malfeasance?


Hmm, probably.


But now I know something
he doesn't want me to know,


so I can use his malfeasance
to establish leverage.


Otherwise,
it's just malfeasance


For malfeasance's sake.


knocks


- Hey.
- I know.


I know.
I know.


- Um...


What happened?


- I--oh.


Just, um, you know,


I was trying--
just the expense reports,


and then--God, Toby, you know?


He just--I know.


I just--I just hope that--oh,
I just hope


that this doesn't affect
our friendship!


sobbing


It's stupid.
It's so stupid.


- Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.


Listen, man, it's--


you know, it's not a big deal.
- Yeah, okay.


- It's gonna be fine.
- I'm fine.


No, I know.
I'm good.


I'm good.
It's just--


- Look, it's one day.


Everything's
gonna be all right.


- Yeah, okay.
- No big deal.


You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.


- Okay.


- Creed, did you organize
the menu book?


- Oh, I thought that was
more on a volunteer basis.


- No, that was mandatory.


- Oh, I thought
it was a volunteer thing.


- Hey.
- Hey.


- Here's your schedule
for next week.


- coughs
- Are you okay?


- Yeah, I'm fine.
Look, about you and Jim--


- Oh, no, that's--
you don't have to--


- No, I just feel
it's my responsibility


as your boss slash friend--
- No, it's really--it's okay.


Um, I know that Jim
had, like, a crush on me


when he first started,


but that was
a long time ago, so...


- It wasn't that long ago.
It was on the booze cruise.


- Jim had a crush on me
on the booze cruise,


or he told you about it
on the booze cruise?


- Uh-oh...okay.


Shut it, Michael.
I'm done.


That's it.
I'm out.


- Ready?
- Yep.


- People are
always coming to me.


"Michael, I have a secret.
You're the only one I trust."


No, thanks,
because keeping a secret


can only lead to trouble.


Like, I was watching Cinemax
last weekend.


This movie...


Portrait of a...Prostitute.


Something...Secrets of a--
"More Secrets of a Call Girl."


And the lead character, Shila,
is framed for murder,


goes on the run, and winds up


working at a bordello
in Malibu.


I don't--I don't wanna
live like that.


I like it here.


I don't wanna be Shila.
I like being Michael Scott.


trumpet flourish


Let's think this through.


If we ask corporate
for that, then...


They are either
gonna say...


yes or no.


(Michael)
Could go either way.


We don't know
what they are going to say.


Think it through!


You have to think it through.


Because if they say no...


Can we not?


No--yes, we have to.
You know why?


'Cause I don't like to be
cooped up in that office.


In that box
all day long.


Heisman!


Because I need to think.
Okay, Jim?


I need to get out here,


I need to zap around
and make connections.


Ooh, ah, ooh!


You know why?


Because that is how I think,
man.


Do you even know how
to throw a spiral?


You said you did
and that is so not a spiral.


Oh, Kevin!
Ooh!


Michael laughing


Ugh!
Nice catch.


Mm, mm, mm, mm.


Oscar!


Intercepted.


Right here.
Give it to me.


Phyllis, give me the ball.


Okay, give me the ball.


You guys...


Creed, give me the ball
right now.


Give it to me.
Ryan.


Dwight screams


Aaaaah!
Fumble!


Yeah!


growling


(Michael)
All right, hey, Dwight!


Dwight cackles


Whoo!


Hut, hut, hut, hike!


(Michael)
You all right, Ryan? Ryan.


Yeah.


sighs


Pam!


soft piano music





upbeat music





My future is so bright, Jim.


(Dwight)
Jim, do you know how bright
my future is?


It's so bright that...


what?


Do you know?


Is there something
I gotta wear? Huh?


Goggles?


imitating rock music


Dwight was the top salesman
of the year at our company.


He wins a little prize money


and gets honored
at some convention.


It is literally the highest
possible honor


that a Northeastern
Pennsylvania-based


mid-size paper company regional
salesman can attain, so...


he's got the right to brag.


Oh, they're having
a sale on TiVo.


Maybe I should get a TiVo.


Ooh, DVD burner.


Maybe I should
get one of those.


sighs


You are so lucky, Jim.


You are so lucky
you don't have this problem.


What was the ninth place
prize again?


A loaf of bread?


Cugino's pizza.


Oh, great.


Tasty, terrific pizza.
Hmm.


Question.
Do their pizzas play DVDs?


What did I do
to deserve this?


(Pam)
Are you sad
that Dwight beat you?


No.


Are you gonna cry, Jim?


Do you need a tissue?


Hey, I heard you got
a wedding dress.


Do you have pictures?


(Pam)
Oh, yeah.


I'll show 'em to you later.
Oh.


Oh, I should get back.
chuckles


Talk to you guys later.


Okay, cool.


I have a ton of stuff
to do for the wedding.


And I have to do it
in the office.


And that can be
kind of awkward.


Uh, just because
people can get all weird


about wedding stuff
and I just--


I don't want to offend...


Angela.
Or someone.


That's what she said.


Ha!


I don't get it.


Grapes, seductive.


So you ready for the
big speech this afternoon?


Well, it's not really
a big speech.


You're still coming, right?


Oh, abso-fruit-ly.


Fruit, grapes.
Nailed the joke.


Matter of time.


Uh, and yes,
it is a big speech.


Biggest of your life.


Speaker
at the sales convention.


Been there, done that.


Went there again,
did it again.


Two years in a row.


Consecutive.


I just--I miss the feeling


of knowing that
you did a good job


because somebody gives you
proof of it.


"Sir, you're awesome.
Here's a plaque.


"What, a whole year
has gone by


"and you need more proof?


Here's a certificate."


They stopped making plaques
that year.


I thought I could just go
and collect my certificate


and shake the man's hand
and say thank you.


They'll be expecting some
words.


First year,
I spoke for nine minutes.


Second year, 11 minutes.


But you know, it doesn't matter
how long you speak.


What matters is that
you make it perfect.


So make it perfect.


(Dwight)
There was a time


where I could've won a trip
to Niagara Falls.


And I think you know
what's there.


But in order to claim
that prize,


I would've had
to shout out


in a room of over 200 people.


I panicked, I froze,
and I paid the price.


Sometimes, the hardest word
in the world to say is "bingo."


What if I give a really long
extended thank you?


For instance,
"Thank you, Mr. Blank.


"Thank you very, very--


That would look terrible.


These are mostly salesmen,


and salesmen expect
to be entertained.


And you are the main act.


When I was
in the sixth grade,


I was a finalist
in our school spelling bee.


It was me against Raj Patel.


And I misspelled,
in front of the entire school,


the word "failure."


I can't do this.


That's because you're incapable
of doing it.


Because you don't know how.


Because you have no skills.


Dwight goes to Michael
for pep talks.


To Michael.


Dwight, there's no way
I can possible teach you


what you need to know about
public speaking by speech time.


Okay.


But I can teach you enough


so that you don't embarrass me
or the company.


Okay, deal.


I'll do whatever you say.
No questions asked.


Well, if you have a question,
you should ask me.


I'll try and think of one.


Don't try to think
of a question to humor me.


Just try not to be
such an idiot.


Is that an insult


or is that part
of the public speaking advice?


Insult.


I'm very confident,
but I don't want the spotlight.


Michael should get
the spotlight.


I should be the guy
in the booth


shining down the spotlight.


takes deep breath


(Pam)
Mom, I'm sorry.


I know you and Dad are
chipping in for the wedding,


but I do not want
orange invitations.


Yes.


Well, if you really want...


Hi, yeah, can I talk to one
of your travel agents?


I'm gonna take a trip.


I'm gonna get out of town
for a while


and go someplace...


not here.
chuckles


Where do I wanna go?


Um, that is
an excellent question.


And one I probably
should have thought about


before I called you.


(Oscar)
I get here early
every morning


so I can set
the thermostat.


I like it a little cooler,
around 66 degrees.


I'm more productive.


Maybe some people don't like
it as cold as I do.


But I don't care.


And what a lot of people don't
understand about...sales


is that it has so much to do
with organization.


I have a system in place
for keeping track


of who I speak to,
when I speak to them,


and what we have discussed.


Et cetera.


That's it?


You're going to end
with et cetera?


Okay, what's this big
organizational system that--


Well, do you think I should
describe our filing system?


No, that would be suicide.
Never--never talk specifics.


Not in a speech.


But the fact that you have
no idea what to say,


is, believe it or not,
the least of our worries.


(Dwight)
It is?
It's your delivery.


What is?
Our biggest worry.


I don't follow.


My God, Dwight. Best way
to learn is by watching.


That's why porn is a
multi-trillion dollar industry.


Let's--okay.
Sit down, let me wow you.


clears throat


screams
Oh, God!


See?


I have your attention now,
don't I?


You're scared, but now you're
ready to learn.


Oh, no. You do not want
to go to India.


It's smelly and it's horrible


and you can't even walk around
by yourself


without getting killed
or worse.


That's what my dad says.


(Jim)
Oh, okay.


Pam!
Oh, my God!


Can we please start sending out


the save the date
announcements?


'Cause your wedding's
on June 10th


and that's right
around the corner


and I know this is weird,


but I really need to know
if I should save the date.


Um--
'Cause if I had
an announcement,


then I could start saving up
for a fancy dress.


But otherwise, I'll just get
a pair of shoes.


No, boots.
coin clinks
in vending machine


But seriously,
what's the difference


between a salesman
and a saleswoman?


Saleswoman has a vagina.


It's a joke, Dwight.
It's not a sex ed class.


But I'm right.


Yeah, you're right about
the difference


between a man and a woman


but not about the punchline
to the joke, all right?


The difference between
a salesman and a saleswoman is


boobs.


Hey, do you remember
the speeches that you gave?


I do, both of them.


Could I have a copy
of one of them?


No, no, they would remember.


Look, it doesn't matter
what you say,


it just matters
that you're saying something


that people care about.


Yeah?


All right, here we go.
Watch this.


Attention everybody!
Attention please.


I have some very great news
from corporate.


We had a wonderful quarter,
and as a result,


all of you are getting bonuses
for $1,000.


Yeah!


(Michael)
Congratulations.


applause and excited chatter


You see that?


You see how
they responded to me?


In that moment,
I had them.


That is so great
about the bonus!


No, no, it's not true.


I was just talking.


So just go out there
and say anything.


They'll eat it up.
They're a great audience.


Go ahead, get the wallpaper.


Wallpaper the ceiling
if you want.


(Dwight)
Excuse me.


May I have
your attention please?


There had been an accident
on 84 West.


Cars have skidded
off the road


into the safety railing.


Several cars have flipped.


There is broken glass
everywhere.


Several people are injured.


Do we know anyone
who was in the accident?


Brad Pitt.


Also, there will be
no bonuses.


Why would this affect
our bonuses?


They're unrelated.


Is Brad okay?


He will never act again.


Also, this branch is closing.


What the hell
is going on here?


Are we out of jobs?


Yes.


This is karma because of what
he did to Jennifer Anniston.


He was kidding.
Dwight was kidding.


And I don't know why
because it wasn't funny


and it was just horrible.


Michael?
Yeah?


You said we were
getting bonuses.


That was just a funny joke,
remember?


You applauded.


So nobody's hurt?


I don't know about that.


People are injured in car
accidents every 4.5 seconds.


Shut


it.
Come on.


Teri, cancel the wallpaper.


Michael sighs


Well, that didn't go well.


No, it did not
and that is because


at no time did you employ
the use of humor.


We'll find you a joke
that not even you can ruin.


laughs


All right. Listen up, please.
Dwight has a joke.


softly
Stop it.


Two sailors walk into a bar.


Please don't tell
a sailor joke.


Oh, why not?


Her nephew's in Iraq.


Iraq is sand.
Sailors are on water.


Yes, but they're both
in danger.


Yeah, well, you know what?
We need to--


all right, everybody
in the conference room now.


Let's go.
Let's do it.


As your leader
and your friend,


I sort of demand
that you can all


speak in public
as I can.


And did.
Twice.


You saw the plaque, right?


(Michael)
All right, we're all
gonna go around the room


and we're going
to make toasts.


And that way,
we will overcome our fear


of public speaking.


You mean Toastmasters?


Pam, I'm public speaking.


Stop public interrupting me.
Okay?


Who's gonna start?
How about Phyllis?


You kick us off and
then we'll move around.


Go ahead.


What are we supposed
to talk about?


Anything your heart desires.


Um, I would like to toast


to the good fortune
I've been having lately.


Louder!


slightly louder
I met a man
and I'm totally in love.


And that's a chapter of my life
that I thought I'd closed.


Uh, I was terribly depressed
for the longest time


and, um, I have to admit,
I had some very dark thoughts.


Good, good, good, good.
That's good.


Now see,
that's not so hard, right?


All right, who's next?
Who are we going to go--ah!


Ryan.
Ryan's next.


Why am I next?
I thought we'd go in order.


Don't be shy, shy boy.


Don't be shy.
Get up there.


Well, a lot of you know
that I'm in business school


and while I'm learning
a lot here,


a lot,


hopefully soon,
I'll land a challenging,


full-time or part-time position
somewhere else.


cheers and applause


Stop, stop, stop, stop!
That's--you know what?


The toasts are really not
supposed to be about anything.


And certainly not supposed
to be about going anywhere


or doing anything else.
So.


Ryan is a temp and that means
that he could go at any time.


Am I worried about that?


Try scared to death.


Who's next?
Pammy.


Oh.
That's okay.


Actually, this would be
good practice


for your wedding toast.


Yeah, the bride doesn't
really do--


Have you ever been
to a wedding?


(Jim)
Can I go?


Yes, good.
Jim taking the initiative.


So, uh,
I am going on a trip.


But I'm not really sure
where I'm going yet.


It's kinda open-ended.


So I was hoping maybe you guys
would have some suggestions.


It's not off to a good start,
but we'll see where this goes.


I really like Florida.
(Jim)
Oh, really?


Like Miami or?
More of the Orlando area.


I've been to Epcot
a dozen times.


It's like a trip
around the world.


Oh, well, I was actually
thinking of taking a trip


around the actual world.


Then you should look into
the Disney cruise.
Okay.


You should go
to Hedonism.


What is that?


It's like Club Med,
but everything is naked.


I was thinking
more like Europe.


Or something like that,
but good second choice.


Been to Amsterdam.


Oh, okay, you know what?


That's not a toast.
You're not standing up.


To Amsterdam.


When did you go there?


Um, after my divorce.


(Jim)
Really?
For like how long?


About a week or...


Maybe a month.
I don't--


Jimmy, listen to me.


You do not want to go
to Amsterdam, trust me.


Where do I wanna go?


I'd send you to Hong Kong.


I know some fun places.
You could hang there.


And I might still have
some friends.


Really?
Really, Creed?


I was a action movie star
in China in the '80s


after my band broke up.


And, um, I played a lot
of police captains.


chuckles


Sometimes a cowboy.
I'm, uh...


kind of a movie star there.


I'd like to say hi
to my friends in China.


speaking Chinese


(Michael)
You know what?


Maybe we should move on
to somebody else.


Okay.
Do you have a suggestion?


Actually, yes. I do.
I have a fantastic suggestion.


(Jim)
All right.


Three words.
(Jim)
Okay.


Vegas, baby, Vegas!
Yes.


Also San Antonio is nice.
River Walk. clicks tongue


Ooh, River Walk?
Like Michael Flatley?


N-no, that's "River Jazz."


Okay, everybody sit down,
please.


Riverdance.


Okay. Dwight.
claps once


Show us what you have
learned today.


Good morning, Vietnam!


all groan


Okay.
My wife is very neat.


Every wrinkle is
in its right place.


A good salesman can convince
his wife


that polyester
is the generic name for mink.


chuckles
Packer.


Okay, you know what?
This isn't working.


Because, um, I'm not nervous
in front of them.


They're my subordinates.


No, we're not.


Uh, yes, you are.


I am the
assistant regional manager.


Which means
absolutely nothing.


Michael, can you explain?


Well, it's mostly made up.
So.


(Michael)
Dwight is not going to do
a good job. It's sad.


And they're
expecting excellence


because I did do
such a great job.


Two years in a row, I killed.
It was amazing.


Confidence, Dwight!


To give you an idea
how well I did,


how much they laughed,
they started laughing...


snaps
Now.


slurps


And that was just my opener.


Dwight, if you could travel
anywhere in the world,


where would you go?


I can travel anywhere,
except Cuba.


And I will travel
to New Zealand


and walk the
Lord of the Ringstrail


to Mordor.


And then I will
hike Mt. Doom.


So now just leave me alone.


Okay, just trying to
get some advice on my trip.


Oh, please,
you're not taking any trip.


You know, I majored
in public speaking in college?


You did?
Mm-hmm.


And the first thing
that they teach you


is that you've gotta be true
to yourself.


And you are all about
authority.


Yes, I am.


The great speakers
throughout history


were not joke-tellers,
they were people of passion.


So, if you wanna
do well today,


you gotta do
what they did.


Which is?


You've gotta wave
your arms,


and you've gotta
pound your fists.


Many times.
pounds fists


So as to emphasize
your point.


Okay, I didn't actually major
in public speaking.


But I did download speeches


from some of history's
famous dictators.


Like this one.


Originally given
by Benito Mussolini.


And this one here was
by his good friend,


Jumpin' Joe Stalin.


And just to change things up...


here's a little Idi Amin.


Okay, look, I know
you're giving this speech


on your own, but I wrote up
a few talking points


for you to take a look at.


Hope you don't mind.


I'll glance at it.


(Creed)
I like it hot.


Really, really hot.


door opens


(Ryan)
I got the stamps.


The ones that say "love"
on them?


The ones that say 39¢.


Oh.
Doesn't matter.


I didn't think it did.


As soon as they leave,
we'll get Kelly and start.


Kelly's helping?
Is that okay?


Yeah, sure.


I don't know what's wrong.


I keep having these hot
and cold flashes.


Uh-oh.


It's time, Dwight.
The Grim Reaper is here.


The very best of luck to you,
Dwight.


Thank you, Angela.


takes deep breath


Ghosts. Lotta ghosts
in this old Radisson.


There it is.
Rosebud room.


Memories.


Wow.
This turnout is pathetic.


I packed the house, you know?


Oh, I don't think this is it.


Numismatic--
Numismatic Collectors.


Nope.
Wrong room.


Okay.


They got sports
medicine seminar. Nope.


Science fiction convention.
Nope.


Oh, yeah. I read about that.


The entire cast
of Battlestar Galactica


is gonna be here
including Starbuck.


I'm so in love with her.


You're weird.


No, no, no.


It's totally normal 'cause
she's not a Cylon or anything.


She's just a great
human fighter pilot.


And if I see her,
my heart will explode.


Are you a 12-year-old girl?


I didn't know--there we go.


Why'd you pick the VA
for the reception?


Roy has a connection.


It's nicer than you think.


You're inviting Jim?


Of course, he's one
of my closest friends.


Okay, so I mulled it over


and I'm not really into India
or Amsterdam.


Or that Morocco package.


Good, right?
So we're narrowing it down.


Okay, let's talk about
East Asia.


Oh, and South America.


No, I'm not trying
to waste your time, Carol.


You know what?


Can you tell me about the India
thing one more time?


Nothing's really jumping out
at me.


So--I mean, the good news is


now I know I want
to take a trip.


So I'll just keep my eyes out
for the next few weeks


and get a great deal.


(Michael)
All right. Ready?

Here we go!

Wow, it's a little bit bigger

Come on, we're down here

Angela sniffles


I am just feeling
under the weather.


And I think that I will
go home and rest.


I've never, ever seen you
take a sick day.


Well, I've seen you take enough
for the both of us.


Next, I'd like to introduce
the Dunder Mifflin


salesman of the year,
Dwight Schrute!


applause


Dwight, they called your name.


(emcee)
Dwight, how we doing?


mumbling
No, I can't do it.


Okay, you know what?


You know what? Okay.
hyperventilating


No--no problem.


You are lucky
you have me here.


I am going
to cover for you.


claps
All right!


applause


whistling


Good morning, Vietnam!


I am not Dwight Schrute.


Not at all.


I am Michael Scott,
his mentor and boss.


Some of you, I'm sure, know me.


I have been honored by this
illustrious group twice


and I think I
am the first person


that was honored by this group
two years in a row.


Does anybody know differently?
Or?


No?


Well, until Dwight comes up,


if he ever does,


I wanted to say
a few words about excellence.


What makes a work environment
excellent?


Well, there are many things,
I believe,


that do such a thing
of that...nature.


And one would be humor.


What is the difference
between a salesman


and a saleswoman?

I always set it at 69.


chuckles


I'm right by the air vent.
I get a lot of dust in my eyes.


Maybe we'll use a DJ.


That's the one thing Roy's
in charge of for this wedding,


but all he's managed to do
is set a date.


Well, he did a great job.
June 10th is perfect.


I want a June wedding.
I've always wanted one.


Ryan, do you know when
you would want to get married?


Actually, I don't see
ever getting married.


Oh.


Ryan, you should be
more sensitive.


It's obvious she likes you,
and comments like that, they--


I know what I said.


I'm very sorry,
I did not know


that you were wearing
a hearing aid


and I just thought
you were speaking...


abnormally.


And now, the Black guy from
the Police Academymovies.


A robot.

Could you shut him up, please?


I mean, who brings a baby

All right,
Dwight Schrute, everyone.


applause


Good luck.
That is a tough crowd.


applause


breathing heavily

Dwight sniffles loudly


Dwight clearing throat


Blood alone moves the wheels
of history!


Have you ever
asked yourselves


in an hour of meditation,


which everyone finds
during the day,


how long we have been striving
for greatness?


Not only the years we've been
at war,


the war of work,


but from the moment,
as a child,


when we realized that the world
could be conquered,


it has been
a lifetime struggle.


A never-ending fight.


I say to you,
and you will understand,


that it is a privilege
to fight!


scattered applause


We are warriors!

(Dwight)
Salesmen of Northeastern
Pennsylvania,


I ask you, once more,
rise and be worthy


of this historical hour!


cheers and applause


Dwight laughing


(Dwight)
Yeah, yeah!


I got a time share
on Key West


that might be available.


Maybe?
Thanks.


You really think
you're gonna go?


Yeah, I'm definitely going.


Nice.
Send me a postcard.


(Ryan)
Jim has worked at the
same place for five years.


Jim eats the same ham
and cheese sandwich


every day for lunch.


I don't know,
if I were a betting man,


I'd say he will have
a fun weekend


in Philadelphia.


exhales deeply


No revolution is worth anything
unless it can defend itself!


applause


(Dwight)
Some people will tell you
"salesman" is a bad word.


They'll conjure up images
of used car dealers


and door-to-door charlatans.


This is our duty
to change their perception.


I say, salesmen...


and women of the world, unite!


We must never acquiesce,
for it is together...


together that we prevail!


We must never cede control
of the motherland,


for it is?


all
Together that we prevail!


wild cheers and applause


Australia?


I have always wanted
to go there.


I'm going.


I'm a little nervous
to run into Dwight


on his connecting flight
to Mordor,


but other than that...


Yeah, I bought the ticket.
Non-refundable.


That's awesome.
Where are you staying?


I don't know.


I feel like I have
plenty of time


to figure out the details,
but...


When are you leaving?


I'm leaving on June 8th.


Oh.


(Jim)
Yeah.


And I'm really sorry
about that. I just--


Oh, yeah,
that's too bad.


Yeah.


Do want me to take these
on my way out?


It's okay, I got it.


All right.


indistinct chatter


Okay, thanks.


There you are.
What happened?


I got thirsty.
How'd it go?


It was amazing. I wish
you would have been there.


You would not believe
what happened here.


What, did something happen?


Oh, this woman came in.
Sat down.


Ordered a drink.


The bartender
asked for her ID,


which I thought was odd.


Because I pegged her at,
like, 35.


Weird.
Yeah, really weird.


So she's like,
"I don't have my ID.


Please give me one."
Uh-huh?


And he's like,
"I can't do that."


I can't serve you.


Con artist.
She might have been.


So she says
"Fine, I will go to my room.


"I will get my purse.
I will come back.


I'll show you my ID."


She hasn't come back yet.


She's probably in the room
drinking from the minibar.


laughing
(Michael)
Right?


(Michael)
Dwight gave a great speech.


That's the word
on the street, anyway.


And I entertained Dwight
to no end with my bar story.


So I captivated the guy
who captivated 1,000 guys.


Can you believe that?
1,000 guys.


- I don't know, Pam.


I paid $400 for this phone,


because I liked the ring.


- You did?
- And now,


I realize that you can program
or download any ring you want,


so I'm...a little overwhelmed.


- Yeah.
- There's a lot of choices.


You got to help me here.
- Okay.


- Which one of these
is coolest?


What do you think?
"Fur Elise" playing





spooky music


- How about that one?
- No, no.


jazz music


- Ooh, that one was good.
- Are you kidding me?


No, that one says,
"I am so lame."


You know which one I want?


There's one that sounds
like a jackhammer.


It just really grabs
your attention.


It's like--
imitating jackhammer


- Okay.


- You know what
I'm talking about?


- Do you mean "vibrate"?


- Yes.


upbeat music





- So...


I'm happy to be here.


It's very nice
to see all of you.


You're all looking well.


- Today's a Women
in the Workplace thing.


Jan's coming in from corporate


to talk to all the women
about, um...


I don't really know what,


but Michael's not allowed in.


She said that
about five times.


- Women today, though we have
the same options as men,


we often face a very
different set of obstacles


in getting there, so--
knock on door


- Hey, what's going on?
- Michael, I--


- Yeah, you know what?
- I thought we agreed--


- I thought about it.
I just have few things


I want to say.
clears throat


- What are you doing?


- Just hear me out.
clears throat


What is more important
than quality?


Equality.


Now, studies show
that today's woman--


the Ally McBeal woman,
as I call her--


is at a crossroads.


- Michael.
- And--no, just, I...


You have come a long way, baby,


but I just--just wanna
keep it within reason.


They did this up in Albany--
- You are not allowed in--


- And they ended up
turning the break room


into a lactation room,
which is disgusting.


- Now you're really
not allowed in this session.


- Well, I'm their boss, so--
- I'm your boss.


- Anybody want any coffee
or anything?


- We're fine, Michael.


We just need you
to leave, please.


- Women in the Workplace.


Yeah, translation:


I have been banned
from my own conference room


so that Jan can talk in secret
to all the girls.


Oh, sorry.
Women of the workplace.


About what?
I don't know.


Clothes, me...


Ick.


- Ladies, I am so, so sorry.


Can we...start again?
We were on such a roll.


I--I really apologize for that.
- Jan.


- Yes, Pam?


- Michael's still at the door.
- Michael!


So one obstacle
is how assertiveness


is perceived differently
in men and women.


Men who are assertive
tend to be admired.


They're called...anyone?


- That's a terrible idea.


- What is?


- Them in there, all together.


They stay in there too long,


they're gonna get
on the same cycle.


Wreak havoc on our plumbing.


- So one obstacle is


how assertiveness is
perceived differently


in men and women.


Men who are assertive
tend to be admired.


They're called...anyone?


- Sexy.
- Confident.


- Great.


Whereas women who are assertive
tend to be labeled...


- The C-word.
- I was gonna say the B-word.


- Everyone.
Guys, circle up, please.


Come on over.
Bring your chairs.


Toby, come on over.


You're a guy too.


mumbles
Sort of.


Let's do this.


- So to be in a position
of leadership,


you often need to be assertive,
right?


You have to be able
to state a firm opinion.


And this means that you have
to give up the fantasy


of being everyone's friend.


clattering


- Well, first of all...
clattering


I, uh, just wanna
warm up a little bit.


Now, I know this is going
to sound crazy to you,


but in India, they do this
thing called laughter therapy,


and I want to try it out.


It's when a group of people
just get together


and they laugh
as hard as they can.


So I want to try that
with you right now.


On the count of three,
let's laugh as hard


and loudly as we can.


Ready?
One, two, three.


laughter


- Oh, my goodness.


- Let's just clap.
Let's just clap.


Ready?


all clapping
Yeah!


Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about!


- Okay, I don't know what
you're doing here, Michael--


- Just having a little
Guys in the Workplace thing.


Why can't boys play with dolls?


Why does society


force us to use urinals


when sitting down
is far more comfortable?


- Can you please do this
somewhere else, Michael?


- We have nowhere else, Jan.


This...


- We could do it
in the warehouse.


- Dwight, excellent idea.
Go to the warehouse.


- Okay, fine.
Yeah, actually, perfect.


Perfect!
You know what?


There is another side
to this place, gentlemen.


And I know we all love
our cushy jobs


and our fun, exciting office,


but do you realize
that underneath us,


there is another world.


The warehouse world.


A world that is teeming
with sweat and dirt


and life!


Life.


The bowels of the office.


These guys are down there.


They are real men
doing real men's work.


Why don't we go down there
and bond with those guys


over some conversation?


- Because men don't bond
over conversation.


They bond over activity.
- Shut it.


Okay. Yes.


Right, so we are going to learn


about being real men for a day.


White collar
and the blue collar.


United.


We are going to learn
how a warehouse works.


- Whoo! Let's go.


- I would love to learn


how an office works.


- We're gonna head down there.


All of us guys,
and all of those guys.


Together.


We're gonna be one guy today.


The office and the warehouse.


The woffice.


Journey of self-discovery.


Oh, I think this is
gonna work out great.


Because managing the warehouse


is a very important part
of my job.


And I haven't been there
in months.


beeping
hip-hop music





- Remember on "Lost,"
when they met the Others?


- I am so sorry about that.


Um, so where were we?


Pam, are you okay
taking notes then?


- Mm-hmm.
- Please?


- Yeah.
- Thank you very much.


hip-hop music


music stops
- Inventive.


All right.
Here we are.


This is cool.
This is cool.


Wow.


Culture shock here, huh?


This is like
"Meet the Fockers,"


except it's
"Meet the Warehouse."


So let's meet the warehouse!


Let's get some shots.


Pan around there.


This is Darryl,
one of our warehouse staff.


Darryl, what is
your biggest fear?


- My biggest fear is
that someone will distract us


from getting all
the shipments out on time.


You know what? Darrell is
actually the foreman here,


and not Roy, which is cool.
pallet jack beeping


There's Roy,
ridin' the big rig!


Um, so Roy is actually
going to be marrying Pam


sometime this summer.


And, uh,
she's our receptionist.


Sort of a Brangelina thing.


- Why?


- Brangelina is
the Brad Pitt and Angelina--


- I don't understand.
- Roy--Roy and Pam.


It's a Ram.


It's a Ram thing.
Not--well...


So, Roy, what do you love
about guys?


- What?
- imitates Roy


Good interview, fella.


chuckles
This guy.


Oh! Get him!


Pan in on him.


I love this guy.
I love this guy!


Tell the camera your name.


- Why don't you tell them
my name?


- I don't want
to mispronounce it.


- It's Lonny.
- That is easy.


So, Lonny, why did you
not get into the NFL?


Was it the knees, or...
I'm sure you were drafted.


- What? Michael,
shouldn't you be upstairs


with the rest of the women?


- Well, I should be
asking the questions.


- Well, why don't you ask me
how I feel about those shoes?


laughter


- Okay.
They're pretty stupid.


laughter continues


Let's trade shoes.
Let me put on your boots.


I want to put on your boots.


Take them off.


All right, so...


- I bet Roy heard
about you liking Pam.


I bet he'll try to beat you up.


- Thanks for
the heads-up, Kev.


- I got your back,
if he does.


But try to stay out of it.


- clears throat


Just in case there's
somebody down here


who shouldn't be.


A little "Good Will Hunting"
situation.


All right, troops.


This is...an important day.
A big day.


Now, you may look around


and see two groups here.


White collar, blue collar.


But I don't see it that way,
and you know why not?


Because I am collar-blind.


I see a group of men.


Do you think


that you are better
than they are?


Well, you're not.
You're worse.


These guys are heroes.
They're men.


Men who work with their hands,
and not their minds.


- What?
- Check out this guy's hands.


Look at that.


Oh, baby soft.
- Stop it.


- He's a pussy.
These guys aren't pussies.


Darryl's not a pussy.
But we're all men!


We're all in the same group.
We're all on the same team.


We're men.
You know what?


I want Darryl
with the grizzled paw


to shake Ryan's hand.


It's okay.


You know what?
He's got soft hands.


You have tough hands.


Look.
Can you do that again?


Can you widen out?


I want Darryl


with the...yeah.


Did you get that? Yeah?


- Why don't we
go around the table


and all say something
that we know we're good at.


I will start.
I am good at public speaking.


- Hi, I'm Meredith,
and I'm an al--


good at supplier relations.


- Great.
Phyllis.


- Um, I'm good
at computer stuff.


Emails, uh, spreadsheets.


All that.
- Really?


- I don't know.
I thought that--


- No. Okay, stop.


- You know, I've seen
some of your spreadsheets.


And I almost always--
- Really?


I thought they were pretty...


- I don't know
how I fit in with these women.


Here.


Or with Jan.


Um, I mean, we get along great.


Fine. Um...


I guess the person I have
the most in common with is...


- Jim.


Halpert.


Hey, uh, I, uh, you know,


heard there's a rumor
going around about,


you know, you used
to have a crush on Pam.


- Oh, no, no, no.
- No, no.


No, it's cool, 'cause I know
you're a good guy,


and I know that that crush
ended a long time ago,


so, you know,


we're cool, right?


- Yeah.
No, yeah, definitely.


- You know,
it's great with me,


'cause that way...


I'm glad
she has a friend at work


she can get
through the day with.


That way, she's not all,
"Bah, bah, bah, bah,"


you know, when she gets home.


- Yeah, I like
talking to her too.


- So, uh...


We're cool, right?
- Yes.


Yeah. All right.
- Good. All right.


- Cool, man.
- Sweet.


- The working man is
the highest form of man.


You know who said that?
- Stalin?


- Not him.
Really?


- Hey, Mike, look.


How about we go upstairs too,
you know?


Learn how an office works?
- Oh, well--


- We can both switch places
for the day.


- Okay. Yeah.
You know what?


I don't...you're...


My job sucks compared to this.


I don't think
you'd like it up there.


Guys! You wanna start
unloading the truck?


- Okay, let's go.


Step up.


- Check this out.


Look at that.
Look at that.


Ba-boop!


"Hello, how are--"
Okay.


That's great.


That is good stuff.


- In five years,
I'd like to be


five years sober.


- That is an excellent goal.


- 4 1/2.


- I'll tell you one thing.


I am not gonna be
one of those women


schlepping her kids around
in a minivan.


- Great.
Uh-huh.


- I want an SUV
with three rows of seats.


- Mm-hmm.
- That would be great.


- Well, I'll be honest,
one of the goals


of these women's seminars is
to feel out


if there's any standouts,


women who could be
a valuable addition


to our corporate life.


- Michael wants us to bond,


so we need topics
for conversation.


- Ponies.
- No.


- How about rainbows?


- No.


- Flowers.
- No.


- Makeup.


- Something cool
that we can all connect about.


- Dolls.
- No.


Like catapults, or--


- "Power Rangers."


- Barrettes.
- No, you guys.


Stanley, do you have anything?


- Uh, retirement?


- That's dangerous.
Mike, come on.


Get down, please.
- No. Hey.


You're gonna hurt yourself.


- Mike--
- Stand clear.


- Mike, get off
of the lift, please!


- I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Come on, now.


- Here we go.
- Would you--look.


Hold on to the--
- Oh, oh, oh!


We'll get somebody
to clean that up.


- We're the ones
that gotta clean that up!


- Damn it, Michael!


- We have to have
this thing serviced.


- So, guys' gripe session.


Here we are.


Now, we definitely live


in different worlds,


but we have a lot in common.


We even like the same girls,


some of us.


And that's gonna happen.


You know, we're guys, so...


- Hey, do you want me to go?


- No, why would I?


You could stay, or--
- I'll go.


- And a big walk-in closet.


- Oh, that's part
of my dream too.


- Oh, me too.


- Great. Okay.


And, Pam, what about you?


What is your dream?


- Well...


I always dreamed of a house
with a terrace upstairs.


Plant flowers on it,
stuff like that.


Since I was a girl.


Um...more seriously, though,


a husband that I love.


Roy.


And...


I love to draw.


And I did a little in college.


And I'd still love
to do something


where I could work with art
or graphic design in some way.


- She's real good.
- Thanks.


- You know,
the company is offering


a design training program
in New York.


- Well, I have a job
right now,


so I can't really
take time off.


- Well, it's--
it's only on weekends,


and then a few weeks
in New York,


but I'm sure that I could
ask corporate to help you out.


- Well, it's just that
the weekends aren't good


because, um--


- There are always a million
reasons not to do something.


- Let's start
with the warehouse.


What bothers you, as guys?
You know?


- My priority is safety.
- Okay.


- So it really bothers me
when somebody comes in here


speeding around on a lift,
playing with it like a toy.


I think it kind of gets
under my skin, okay?


- Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shh, shh.


- Uh-uh, don't--
don't shush me.


- No, I--that was just--


- That bothers me too.
- I was breathing.


- Pam shushes me.
It drives me crazy.


- I hate shushing, you know?
That's the thing.


What both--okay.


What is our beef,


as...human men?


- You know, that's
a good question, Hasselhoff.


laughter


- Okay.
- What bugs us?


- All right, good.


Guys raggin' on each other.


That's what guys do.
And we love it.


- All right,
let's talk about...


clothing.


- I'm excited about today.


whispering
I love girl talk.


- Dress for the job you want,
not the job you have.


All right, you can
use your clothing


to send a message
about your ambitions


by wearing clothes that reflect
what you aspire to be.


- I'm not gaining anything
from this seminar.


I'm a professional woman.


The head of accounting.


I'm in the healthiest
relationship of my life.


I just think it's insulting
that Jan thinks we need this.


And apparently,


judging from her outfit,


Jan aspires to be a whore.


- I hate it when girls insist
on taking them out


to restaurants
every weekend night,


and then, they're like,


"When are we gonna go
on a date-date?"


- Oh, I hate that too, man.
- Exactly!


- I hate that too.
- That sucks so hard.


- It totally sucks.
- Yeah!


And then they make you drive
'em to church the next morning.


Like, gas ain't free!


- Yeah, on our salaries, man,
what do they expect, you know?


What, "take us out
every weekend"?


You know what I mean?
- I feel you, man.


- We're not millionaires.
- I feel you.


- No, you don't.
You don't feel us.


How can you?
You--you know what?


- Not literally.
- You say we're the same,


but we get compensated
very differently.


We work the same hours as you,


and you just said
we work a lot harder.


- Uh, you do, so--


- But we get paid a lot less.


- N...y...
- Word.


- Like, next to no benefits.
- I know.


God, what is that?!
- Exactly!


- It blows.
It blows, man!


- You know,
this would not happen


if we had a union.


- That's what
I'm talking about.


- Yeah...no.
- Absolutely.


- That's what we need to do.


Man, see, that's
what I been sayin', man.


We need to do this finally.


- You know what?
Is that necessary?


'Cause you already sort of
have a union...of guys.


- It's more than necessary,
Mike.


We need this.


Roy, you still have that card


from the dock workers' union?
- In my truck.


- Man, hook it up.
Come on, man!


Let's unionize, baby!
applause


- Yeah, you know what,
I think, uh...


Problem is the chicks.
- That's what it's time for!


Union, yeah!
- The problem is the chicks.


And you gotta blame them.


- Are you with us, Mike?


- weakly
Yeah, s...


- Welcome to the warehouse.


all: chanting
Michael! Michael! Michael!


- Another issue is
inequality of pay


between men and women.


I'm sure that all of you
have dealt with that before.


knock on door
- This is important.


Ladies, take a breather.
clears throat


Jan, I, uh...


wanted...


Can I help you?


Um, I wanted to say
that the guys downstairs


are thinking about
forming a union.


And they have some good points.
- What? A union?


- Don't get hysterical.
- I'm not.


- Part of my job is
knowing how to talk to women.


Let's...be...rational...here.


What are the pros?
What are the cons--


- The cons are that everyone
will lose their job, Michael.


Everyone.
Office, warehouse.


What do you think
the...pros...are...here?


- Don't talk to me
that way, please.


Just...they're gonna
wanna hear this from you.


- Oh, you got yourself
into this, Michael,


so you get yourself out.
- But we're bonding down there!


I mean, I just don't wanna
have to tell them something


they're not gonna wanna hear!
- Now who's getting hysterical?


- Okay. Come on, Jan.
After all we've been through.


- Michael, Michael--
- We have a history.


- Michael, Michael.
- We have a history between us.


- Don't say another word.


Get yourself downstairs.


- I'm just saying
that we have something...


Okay, whatever.


- British Masters is hard
to beat for long distance.


A great point.
- Yeah.


I got a spud gun in my car.
- Really?


- Yeah, shoot a chunk of potato
at your face,


PSI,


bon appétit.


- What are you guys
talking about?


both: Guns.
- Cool.


- How's that, uh,
union stuff coming?


- Working on it.


- Yeah?
- Yeah.


- Okay.
- All right.


- You ever shot a moose?


- No.
- blows raspberry


- You know what?


We could get this done
a lot quicker


if we formed
a type of assembly line.


- This here is
a run-out-the-clock situation.


Just like upstairs.


- Sports metaphors are
one of the ways


women feel left out
of the language of the office.


Now, I know
this might sound silly,


but many women ask
to go over it.


So "fumble" means--
- Mistake.


- Slip.
- Right.


"Par for the course"
is a golf term.


It means right on track.


Uh, "below par" means worse.


Wait, that should mean better.
That doesn't make sense.


- What about "second base"?


Like if Michael said
he got to second base with you?


Does that mean
you, like, closed a deal?


- Excuse me?
- clears throat


- I mean, that's
a baseball term, right?


- I don't know
what Michael was...


talking about.
I don't know.


- Like, you went to Chili's,


and he got to second base
with you.


- Excuse me.


- Kelly, I don't know
what Michael was talking about.


- He just told everybody,
and I just wanna know...


- Hey.


- Hey!
- How's it going down there?


- It's a complete--
well, actually,


it's exactly what you'd expect.


So...
- Right.


- How are the girls?
- Good.


We watched a video
about our changing bodies.


- Did you really?


- No.
- Oh.


- Almost.
- Oh, that's...


- Um, but, hey, um,
something kind of cool.


There's this internship
in graphic design


that Jan was telling us about.


She made it sound,
like, really great.


- Nice!
Well, what's it all about?


- Um--
- I think you should do it.


both chuckle
That's great!


- It's really cool.


- Cold front comin' in
to the warehouse!


Uh-oh!


Better put on your ski boots!


laughs


Wooooow!


Happy New Year, Darryl!


Hey, Darryl!


You ever done this?


Better put on
your thermal jammy!


It's gonna get cold!


Snowball fight!
Whoo!


laughs


- Snow angel!
- Snow angel!


- Are you married?


- I'm divorced.


- That must have been hard.
- It was. Yes.


- You were probably feeling
really depressed and sad,


and that's why you did
that thing with Michael.


- I think you should all
spend a little more time


thinking about your careers and
less time on personal stuff.


- Mm, I think we're all okay
with the balance we've struck.


- At least you don't have kids.


You have no kids, right?
Thank God.


- Okay, I think that, you know,
finding a balance between--


- Jan, you and I
have so much in common.


My career is so much more
fulfilling than my family too.


I can't stand my kid.


- And you had
to change your name back.


That's so humiliating.


- Okay, let's take five.
I think we could all use five.


- How can someone so beautiful
be so sad?


- I know.
It's really...unsettling.


- I would not trade shoes
with her.


- Hey, look at us, huh?


All working together,
getting along.


United.
Band of brothers.


- Like a union.
- Better.


- Hey, what the hell, man?


- You don't tell her
what to do, all right?


- I was just giving her
my opinion.


- Yeah, well, it has nothing
to do with you!


That's between her and me,
all right?


You got to respect that!


- All right. Come on, you guys.
Break it up!


- Guys, check it out!


Spud gun.


Whoo-hoo!
Bon appétit!


quietly
Sorry.


- That's my office.


- Hi.


- Did you take care
of the situation?


- Yeah, yeah.


Yes, I...


I have essentially--
- Excuse me.


Excuse me.
- Yes, I've take--


- I'm told that
there's been some interest


in forming a union,
and that Michael supported it.


Obviously, he's not
a friend of yours,


because he didn't tell you
the facts, so let me.


If there is even a whiff
of unionizing in this branch,


I can guarantee you the branch
will be shut down like that.


They unionized in Pittsfield,


and we all know
what happened in Pittsfield.


It will cost each of you
a fortune in legal fees


and union dues,
and that'll be nothing


compared to the cost
of losing your jobs.


So I would think long and hard


before sacrificing your savings
and your futures


just to send a message.


If you have
any further questions,


you can direct them to...


To Michael.


- Oh, that.
The terrace?


I don't even know
why I brought that up.


Um, dreams are just that.


They're dreams.


They help
get you through the day.


Like the thing
about the terrace.


It's nice,


but, um, I don't know.


It was just something I read
in this book when I was 12.


Uh, the girl in the book
has a terrace


outside of her bedroom.


And she planted flowers on it.


And I just loved that.


It just always kind of stuck
with me.


- So you're not doing it?


- How did you know?


- Why not?


- Just not--no big reason.


Just a bunch of little reasons.


- Come on.
- Roy's right.


There's no guarantee it's
gonna lead to anything anyway.


- Roy said that?


- What? You have something
you wanna say?


- You gotta take a chance
on something sometime, Pam.


I mean, do you wanna be
a receptionist here, always?


- Oh, excuse me!


I'm fine with my choices.


- You are?


- Yeah.


It's impractical.


I'm not gonna...
try to get a house like that.


Um, they don't even make houses
like that in Scranton,


so I'm never gonna...


- Rule number one
of the warehouse:


never outload
the outgoing order.


laughter


Y'all look a little sweaty.


We didn't tell you
to take it off the truck.


- Give yourselves
a round of applause!


- Very nice work.
applause


laughter
- Whoo!


- Those are the smart ones.
- Man!


- I'm just gonna push this
over there!


- This is not a good idea
right here.


- Easy does it. Okay.


Pizza.


Great equalizer.


Rich people love pizza.
Poor people love pizza.


White people love pizza.
Black people love pizza.


Do Black people like pizza?


Hey, um...


Look, guys, I'm sorry.


Sometimes, Jan...


lowers voice
can be such a bitch.


all agree


Hey, watch it.
Watch it.


We have a relationship.


Well, we need to head upstairs.


Stanley, you wanna...


hang out with your friends
for a bit?


All right.


Thank you to our hosts.


- Hey, Michael!


This ain't over.


- sighs
Excellent.


Excellent.
Productive.


Informative day.


- There was this film
that I saw when I was little.


It was about a kid


who goes the most
incredible adventure.


And even though
it was really great


and she had a great time,


she ends up back home in Kansas
and says,


"There's no place like home."


And that's how I feel
right now.


There is no place like home.


What the hell
was that movie called?


So...


sighs
It's gonna drive me crazy.


- I love her shoes.


- Me too.


- I don't.


- Uh, maybe I don't.


- I'm happy this thing is over.


I understand
where Jan was coming from,


but I didn't like it so much.


I mean, she made me feel bad
for being happy


with where I am.


- Is it good to be back?
Yeah.


I mean,
I love the guy stuff, but...


to run an office,
you need men and women.


You know why?


Because you need to have
that crazy sexual tension


to keep things interesting.


- sighs


telephone rings


- Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.


Uh, hold, please.


- Why are you even
filming this?


I'm walking. Let's see how
interesting I can make this.


How's that?
Is that getting better?


How about that?
When I turn the corner?


I pretend
I'm a racecar sometime.

And I'm fat, so sometime,
I got to take a breath.

Don't tape me.


I'm wanted in three states.
