They stay in there too long , they &apos;re gonna get on the same <unk> .

Let &apos;s do this .
- So to be in a position of leadership , you often need to be assertive , right ?
You have to be able to <unk> a <unk> opinion .
And this means that you have to give up the <unk> of being everyone &apos;s friend .
clattering - Well , first of all ... clattering I , uh , just wanna warm up a little bit .
Now , I know this is going to sound crazy to you , but in India , they do this thing called laughter <unk> , and I want to try it out .
It &apos;s when a group of people just get together and they laugh as hard as they can .
So I want to try that with you right now .
On the count of three , let &apos;s laugh as hard and loudly as we can .
Ready ?

Man , see , that &apos;s what I been sayin &apos; , man .

knock on door - This is important .
Ladies , take a breather .
clears throat Jan , I , uh ... wanted ... Can I help you ?
Um , I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union .
And they have some good points .
- What ?

Just ... they &apos;re gonna wanna hear this from you .
- Oh , you got yourself into this , Michael , so you get yourself out .
- But we &apos;re <unk> down there !
I mean , I just don &apos;t wanna have to tell them something they &apos;re not gonna wanna hear !
- Now who &apos;s getting hysterical ?
- Okay .
Come on , Jan. After all we &apos;ve been through .
- Michael , Michael-- - We have a history .

We could get this done a lot <unk> if we <unk> a type of <unk> line .
- This here is a <unk> situation .
Just like upstairs .
- <unk> <unk> are one of the ways women feel left out of the <unk> of the office .
Now , I know this might sound <unk> , but many women ask to go over it .
So &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> - <unk> .
- <unk> .
- Right .
&quot; <unk> for the course &quot; is a golf term .
It means right on track .
Uh , &quot; below <unk> &quot; means worse .
Wait , that should mean better .
That doesn &apos;t make sense .
- What about &quot; second base &quot; ?
Like if Michael said he got to second base with you ?
Does that mean you , like , closed a deal ?
- Excuse me ?
- clears throat - I mean , that &apos;s a <unk> term , right ?
- I don &apos;t know what Michael was ... talking about .
I don &apos;t know .
- Like , you went to Chili &apos;s , and he got to second base with you .
- Excuse me .
- Kelly , I don &apos;t know what Michael was talking about .
- He just told everybody , and I just wanna know ... - Hey .
- Hey !
- How &apos;s it going down there ?
- It &apos;s a <unk> well , actually , it &apos;s exactly what you &apos;d expect .
So ... - Right .
- How are the girls ?
- Good .
We watched a video about our changing <unk> .
- Did you really ?
- No .
- Oh .
- Almost .
- Oh , that &apos;s ... - Um , but , hey , um , something kind of cool .
There &apos;s this <unk> in graphic design that Jan was telling us about .
She made it sound , like , really great .
- Nice !
Well , what &apos;s it all about ?
- Um-- - I think you should do it .
both chuckle That &apos;s great !
- It &apos;s really cool .
- Cold front comin &apos; in to the warehouse !
Uh-oh !

<unk> fight !
Whoo !
laughs - Snow angel !
- Snow angel !
- Are you married ?
- I &apos;m divorced .
- That must have been hard .
- It was .
Yes .
- You were probably feeling really depressed and sad , and that &apos;s why you did that thing with Michael .
- I think you should all spend a little more time thinking about your <unk> and less time on personal stuff .
- Mm , I think we &apos;re all okay with the balance we &apos;ve <unk> .
- At least you don &apos;t have kids .
You have no kids , right ?
Thank God .
- Okay , I think that , you know , <unk> a balance <unk> - Jan , you and I have so much in common .
My career is so much more <unk> than my family too .
I can &apos;t stand my kid .
- And you had to change your name back .
That &apos;s so <unk> .
- Okay , let &apos;s take five .
I think we could all use five .
- How can someone so beautiful be so sad ?
- I know .
It &apos;s really ... <unk> .
- I would not trade shoes with her .
- Hey , look at us , huh ?
All working together , getting along .
United .
<unk> of brothers .
- Like a union .
- Better .
- Hey , what the hell , man ?
- You don &apos;t tell her what to do , all right ?
- I was just giving her my opinion .
- Yeah , well , it has nothing to do with you !
That &apos;s between her and me , all right ?
You got to respect that !
- All right .
Come on , you guys .
Break it up !
- Guys , check it out !
<unk> gun .
Whoo-hoo !
<unk> appÃ©tit !
quietly Sorry .
- That &apos;s my office .
- Hi .
- Did you take care of the situation ?
- Yeah , yeah .
Yes , I ...
I have <unk> - Excuse me .
Excuse me .
- Yes , I &apos;ve <unk> - I &apos;m told that there &apos;s been some interest in forming a union , and that Michael <unk> it .
Obviously , he &apos;s not a friend of yours , because he didn &apos;t tell you the <unk> , so let me .
If there is even a <unk> of <unk> in this branch , I can guarantee you the branch will be shut down like that .
They <unk> in Pittsfield , and we all know what happened in Pittsfield .
It will cost each of you a fortune in <unk> <unk> and union <unk> , and that &apos;ll be nothing compared to the cost of losing your jobs .
So I would think long and hard before <unk> your <unk> and your <unk> just to send a message .
If you have any further questions , you can direct them to ... To Michael .
- Oh , that .
The terrace ?
I don &apos;t even know why I brought that up .
Um , dreams are just that .
They &apos;re dreams .
They help get you through the day .
Like the thing about the terrace .
It &apos;s nice , but , um , I don &apos;t know .
It was just something I read in this book when I was 12 .
Uh , the girl in the book has a terrace outside of her bedroom .
And she <unk> flowers on it .
And I just loved that .
It just always kind of stuck with me .
- So you &apos;re not doing it ?
- How did you know ?
- Why not ?
- Just not--no big reason .
Just a bunch of little reasons .
- Come on .
- Roy &apos;s right .
There &apos;s no guarantee it &apos;s gonna lead to anything anyway .
- Roy said that ?
- What ?
You have something you wanna say ?
- You gotta take a chance on something sometime , Pam .
I mean , do you wanna be a receptionist here , always ?
- Oh , excuse me !
I &apos;m fine with my choices .
- You are ?
- Yeah .
It &apos;s <unk> .
I &apos;m not gonna ... try to get a house like that .
Um , they don &apos;t even make <unk> like that in Scranton , so I &apos;m never gonna ... - Rule number one of the warehouse : never <unk> the <unk> order .
laughter Y &apos;all look a little sweaty .
We didn &apos;t tell you to take it off the truck .
- Give yourselves a round of applause !
- Very nice work .
applause laughter - Whoo !
- Those are the smart ones .
- Man !
- I &apos;m just gonna push this over there !
- This is not a good idea right here .

Okay .

Great <unk> .

Poor people love pizza .

Hey , um ... Look , guys , I &apos;m sorry .
Sometimes , Jan ... <unk> voice can be such a bitch .
all agree Hey , watch it .
Watch it .
We have a relationship .
Well , we need to head upstairs .

All right .
Thank you to our <unk> .
- Hey , Michael !
This ain &apos;t over .
- sighs Excellent .
Excellent .

- There was this <unk> that I saw when I was little .
It was about a kid who goes the most incredible <unk> .
And even though it was really great and she had a great time , she <unk> up back home in <unk> and says , &quot; There &apos;s no place like home . &quot;
And that &apos;s how I feel right now .
There is no place like home .
What the hell was that movie called ?
So ... sighs It &apos;s gonna drive me crazy .
- I love her shoes .
- Me too .
- I don &apos;t .
- Uh , maybe I don &apos;t .
- I &apos;m happy this thing is over .
I understand where Jan was coming from , but I didn &apos;t like it so much .
I mean , she made me feel bad for being happy with where I am .
- Is it good to be back ?
Yeah .
I mean , I love the guy stuff , but ... to run an office , you need men and women .
You know why ?
Because you need to have that crazy sexual <unk> to keep things interesting .
- sighs telephone rings - Dunder Mifflin .
This is Pam .
Uh , hold , please .
- Why are you even <unk> this ?
I &apos;m walking .
Let &apos;s see how interesting I can make this .
How &apos;s that ?
Is that getting better ?
How about that ?
When I turn the corner ?
I pretend I &apos;m a <unk> sometime .
imitates engine revving imitates tires squealing imitates engine revving And I &apos;m fat , so sometime , I got to take a breath .
inhales deeply , exhales - What ?
