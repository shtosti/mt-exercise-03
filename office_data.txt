[mellow music]

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,524
* *

3
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,795
Tonight is the Dundies,

4
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,757
the annual employee awards night
here at Dunder Mifflin.

5
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,885
And this is everybody's
favorite day.

6
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,054
Everybody looks forward to it.

7
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,348
Because, you know,
a lot of the people here

8
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,142
don't get trophies
very often.

9
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,518
Like Meredith or Kevin.

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,853
I mean, who's gonna give
Kevin an award,

11
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,104
Dunkin' Donuts?

12
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,357
Plus, bonus,
it's really, really funny.

13
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,026
So I--You know, an employee
will go home,

14
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,945
and he'll tell his neighbor,
"Hey, did you get an award?"

15
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,864
And the neighbor'll say,
"No, man."

16
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,325
I mean, I slave all day.
Nobody notices me.

17
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,910
Next thing you know,

18
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,620
employee
smells something terrible

19
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,455
coming from
the neighbor's house.

20
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,832
Neighbor's hanged himself.

21
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:24,876
Due to lack of recognition.

22
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,503
So...

23
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,966
Wow.

24
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,344
Those are, um...gleaming.

25
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,638
You buy a new pair
every day, or...

26
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,264
I like keeping them
new-looking.

27
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,642
[Jim chuckles]

28
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:43,520
So you ready for...
the Dundies?

29
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,896
Ugh.

30
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,398
(Pam)
You know what they say
about a car wreck,

31
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:49,234
where it's so awful,
you can't look away?

32
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,861
The Dundies are like
a car wreck that

33
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,614
you wanna look away
but you have to stare at it

34
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,826
because your boss
is making you.

35
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,077
Hey-hey-hey!

36
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,121
It's Fat Halpert!

37
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,207
What?

38
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,583
Fat Halpert!

39
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,460
Jim Halpert.

40
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:11,756
So why don't I take
you on a tour

41
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,466
of past Dundie winners?

42
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:16,594
We got Fat Jim Halpert here.

43
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,847
Jim, why don't you show off
your Dundies to the camera?

44
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,724
Oh, I can't
because I keep them hidden.

45
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,143
I don't wanna look at them
and get cocky.

46
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,394
Oh!
That's a good idea.

47
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:25,437
(Dwight)
And mine are at home,

48
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,022
in a display case
above my bed.

49
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,108
Yeeaacck! TMI.
TMI, my friends.

50
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,234
(Michael)
TMI?

51
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,610
Too Much Information.

52
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,530
Uh, it's just easier
to say TMI.

53
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,699
I used to say "Don't go there,"
but that's lame.

54
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:40,201
And here we have
Stanley the Manley.

55
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,995
Now, Stanley
is a Dundie all-star.

56
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,371
Aren't you, Stanley?

57
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,165
Why don't you, uh,
show them some of your bling.

58
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,541
I don't know where they are.

59
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,917
I think I threw
them out.

60
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,294
Oh, no, you di-in't.

61
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:51,963
Uh, think I did.

62
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,798
Mm--Why did--

63
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,468
Say, we gotta order some more
appe-teasers this time

64
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,219
We ran out last year,
remember?

65
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,471
Yes, we should.
I--You know what?

66
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,140
I wanted one of those
skillets of cheese.

67
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,683
But when I got off stage,

68
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:07,354
someone had eaten
all of them.

69
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,607
I am psyched for the Dundies.

70
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,734
I got a sitter for my kid.

71
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,070
I am gonna drink frozen drinks

72
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,280
paid for by Dunder Mifflin.

73
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,824
I'm gonna eat some good
Chili's food

74
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:23,828
and hopefully...
meet someone nice at the bar.

75
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,413
I love the Dundies.
The only thing

76
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,040
I don't like about the Dundies

77
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:30,001
is that Michael thinks I have
the gene for alcoholism,

78
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,254
and so he cuts me off
after like two drinks.

79
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,049
I usually share a table
with Phyllis.

80
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,760
[inhales, exhales]

81
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,512
Well...

82
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,722
I haven't eaten anything
all day.

83
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,935
And I think I'm gonna
skip lunch

84
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:51,773
so that I can maximize
my food at the Dundies.

85
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,901
I think I'm gonna share some
Cadillac Fajitas with Toby.

86
00:03:54,943 --> 00:04:00,240
Toby is so cute...except
he has that stupid kid.

87
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,991
There's a lot of drinking
at the Dundies,

88
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,911
and people say
very inappropriate things.

89
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,250
I never should have had
that drink last year.

90
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,335
One year, I didn't go,

91
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,045
and then what happens is

92
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,298
Michael tells you about it
over and over again.

93
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,384
Like for a month.

94
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:22,012
So it's--
it's less painful to go

95
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,389
and just get it over with...

96
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,890
than...than not go.

97
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,184
You think you're getting
away with it.

98
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,978
Well, you're not.

99
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,356
Yes, I'm the designated driver,
which is very important.

100
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,067
We need everyone
to get home safely.

101
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,403
But no one ever gives me
gas money,

102
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,239
and people live all over.

103
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,241
It's expensive.

104
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,161
[inaudible conversation]

105
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,954
Pfff.

106
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,081
Like a gaggle of geese.

107
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,958
[high voice]
Mee-mee-mee-mee.

108
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,589
[giggling]
It was you.

109
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,882
It wasn't.
I swear.

110
00:04:58,923 --> 00:04:59,966
Yeah, it was.

111
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,009
So what's the joke?

112
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,260
You're not perfect either.

113
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,554
We're not laughing
at you, Dwight.

114
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,764
So who are we
laughing at?

115
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,016
Um, just something
somebody wrote.

116
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,726
Who? Dave Barry?

117
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,227
No, no.

118
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,147
Just something that was written
on the ladies room wall.

119
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,398
What is it?
Who wrote it?

120
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,275
Um, it's kind of private.

121
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,860
[whispering]
It's about Michael.

122
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:19,986
[giggling]

123
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,988
That is defacement
of company property.

124
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,239
So you'd better tell me.

125
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,451
Kelly, if you tell me,
you'll be punished less.

126
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,204
Okay, now I'm laughing
at you.

127
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,789
[giggling]

128
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,832
It hasn't always been easy
being a whistleblower.

129
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,459
When I was in school,
the kids would call me

130
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,544
a tattletale
or a snitch or a worm.

131
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:41,800
So I really identify
with those women from Enron.

132
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:44,594
I wrote them letters to tell
them how much they inspired me,

133
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,805
but they never wrote back.

134
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,017
I guess they're all married.

135
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,019
All right,
we need something for Kevin.

136
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:54,646
(Jim) Mmm-hmmm.
What do we know about him?

137
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,022
He's an accountant.

138
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,317
He plays guitar,
he likes naval history.

139
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,695
He's a bowler.
He's fat.

140
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,406
The fat accountant award.

141
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,533
Well, you seem to
have this under control.

142
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,576
The weird part
about this whole deal

143
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,745
is that Michael truly believes

144
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,998
that these awards are
inspiring and motivational.

145
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,168
I mean, he puts more effort
and time and commitment

146
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,214
into the Dundies than anything
else he does all year.

147
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,719
Which is probably why
this branch will be downsized.

148
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,138
(Michael)
I am the fat accountant.
Michael, I need to talk to you.

149
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,848
Here he is.

150
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,391
I just thought
that you might like to know

151
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,226
that someone has written
something about you

152
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:36,021
on the ladies' room wall.
Really?

153
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,605
What did they say?

154
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,315
"For a good time,
call Michael Scott"?

155
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,359
Good one.
Uh, no, no.

156
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,653
No, I think
something bad, maybe.

157
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,405
Why do you think that?

158
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,949
You just immediately
go to that, Dwight?

159
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,576
Why are you so negative?
Why are you--

160
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,702
Michael.
I mean, you just come in,

161
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,370
and you're just negative...
Michael.

162
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,830
...and you just walk
negatively.

163
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,124
Do you want me to find out
what it says?

164
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,295
Yes.

165
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,964
By any means necessary?
What does that even mean?

166
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:04,591
What are you...what are
you talking about?

167
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,925
(Dwight)
It's the ladies' room.

168
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,594
Just go and find out what
it says and who said it

169
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:09,179
and report back to me.

170
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,223
But don't tell anybody that I
have anything to do with it,

171
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,685
because if they ask me, I
will say that you are crazy.

172
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,937
Thank you.
You won't regret this, Michael.

173
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,526
What award would you
like to give Dwight?

174
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,986
I hadn't planned on
including him.

175
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:26,071
Okay.

176
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,113
Kevin.

177
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,420
To Oscar Martinez,

178
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,423
it's the
Show Me the Money award.

179
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,968
Michael has taped
every Dundies Awards.

180
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,429
And now he's making me
look through

181
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,766
hours of footage
to find highlights.

182
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,309
For the ladies.
Hit it, Dwight.

183
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:59,688
[playing flute]

184
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,982
* A little bit of Pam
all night long *

185
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,444
* A little bit of Angela
on the thing *

186
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,779
(Pam)
Oh, yeah.

187
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,656
This is the part
where Kevin sat

188
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,449
in front of the camcorder
all night.

189
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,159
It's great.

190
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,369
* A little bit of Roy
eating chicken crispers *

191
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:17,747
* A little bit of Tim
with some ribs *

192
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,499
* A little bit of Matt-- *

193
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,504
Angela, it's simple.

194
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:26,339
Just tell me what
the bathroom wall says.

195
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,508
I don't talk about
what goes on in the restroom.

196
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,885
I'm not asking
what you do in there.

197
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,513
I just want to know
what's written about Michael.

198
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,390
I don't say those kinds of
things out loud.

199
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,559
It's inappropriate.

200
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,728
Okay, I'll talk.

201
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,397
You nod if I get it right.

202
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,233
Does it have to do with
his butt or his wiener?

203
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:47,068
[Angela sighs]

204
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:53,283
Will her highness
Jan Levinson-Gould

205
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,745
be descending from her corporate
throne this evening

206
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,623
to visit us lowly serfs
here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?

207
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:03,668
It's a two-and-a-half-hour
drive from New York, Michael.

208
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,961
Well, you could take the bus.

209
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,921
You could work
on the way here,

210
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,923
sleep on the way home.
No.

211
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,967
Come on, Jan.
This is important.

212
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:13,219
I mean, this is,
this is validation

213
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,554
to my employees here

214
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,431
that you and corporate
approve of this.

215
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,850
Well, we don't
approve of this, Michael.

216
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,602
W--
I mean, you only have
the budget

217
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,604
for one office party
a year, so...

218
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,981
we're not paying for this.

219
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,107
Um--

220
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,402
Can you--?

221
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,528
Are you there, Michael?
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

222
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,614
I just wanted to, uh...

223
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,240
talk to you for
a second about that.

224
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:37,035
Um, what, uh, what is--

225
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,496
I mean, come on!
Jan.

226
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,831
What's--You're droppin'
an A-bomb on me here.

227
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:43,958
Really? I'm dropping
an atomic bomb on you?

228
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,543
Well, yeah.
I mean, what is--

229
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,045
Right.

230
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,880
You already had a party
on May 5th for no reason.

231
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:52,175
No reason!
It was the 05-05-05 party.

232
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:53,927
It happens once
every billion years.

233
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,220
And you had a luau.

234
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,888
And the tsunami relief
fundraiser,

235
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,807
which somehow
lost a lot of money.

236
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,059
Okay, no, that was
a funraiser.

237
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,894
I think I made that
very clear in the flyers.

238
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,604
Okay, well, I don't
understand why anyone...

239
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,731
Fun. F-U-N.
...would have a tsunami
fun raiser, Michael.

240
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,149
Well, I think
a lot of people

241
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,110
were very affected
by the footage.

242
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,238
All right, just watch
the off-color jokes.

243
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,573
I got a lotta complaints
from H.R. last year.

244
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,367
Ugh, well, that's Toby.

245
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,077
Jerk-face. He, uh...

246
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:21,538
hasn't won a Dundie,
and it's sour grapes,

247
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,081
and he's a very bitter,
bitter...

248
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,083
[Jan sighs]
...young balding man.

249
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,793
All right.
I gotta go, Michael.

250
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,753
What? Okay.
We'll talk about this later.

251
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,588
No, this all sounds great.
This sounds great.

252
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,716
[Jan, indistinct]
So maybe we'll see you later.

253
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,802
Okay. All right, buh-bye.

254
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,224
Oh, let's see.
What's on the computer?

255
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,146
Uh, yes, that's true.
I have never won a Dundie.

256
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,858
I am more than okay with that.

257
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:53,236
It's a little character
I like to do.

258
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,698
It is, uh,
loosely based on Carnac,

259
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:59,409
one of Carson's
classic characters.

260
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,287
Here we go.

261
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,955
The PLO, the IRA,

262
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,708
and the hot dog stand
behind the warehouse.

263
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,794
[rips envelope]

264
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,550
Name three businesses that have
better healthcare plans

265
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:17,177
than Dunder Mifflin.

266
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,264
Here's the problem.

267
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,434
There's no open bar
because of Jan.

268
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,062
And it's the reason why

269
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,815
comedy clubs have
a two-drink minimum.

270
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,027
I mean, it'll be fine,
I just...

271
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:37,280
wish people were gonna be drunk.

272
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,283
I think his characters
are pretty funny.

273
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:42,660
Especially Ping.

274
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,329
Well, what should I do, guys?

275
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,623
Seriously, do you want me to
just cancel the Dundies?

276
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,667
No, we were just hoping you
wouldn't do those characters

277
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,335
like last time.
Ping?

278
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:53,505
Everybody loves Ping.
He's my most popular character.

279
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,633
I think many people find
that character slightly racist.

280
00:11:56,675 --> 00:12:00,261
Really?
Well, he is based on

281
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,930
the Chinese delivery
guy that I have

282
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,515
who talks exactly like that,

283
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,976
so I think you should take it
up with him instead of me.

284
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:10,063
Well, I'm just saying
there are many people

285
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,440
that are offended
by your insensitive skits.

286
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:15,360
[sighs] Well, neither of you
are Chinese, so what...

287
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,737
Why do you care?

288
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,294
(Phyllis)
Dwight, get out of here.

289
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,504
What are you doing
in the ladies room?
It's not what you--

290
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,047
No! Why were you in there?

291
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,882
You are a pervert!
What were you doing in there?

292
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,300
I am not.
I'm telling Michael.

293
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,177
I am on official business.
Michael!

294
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,721
Phyllis, you are not.
Michael!

295
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,014
No--stop it!

296
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,348
Stop it!
Michael.

297
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,600
Michael--no, do not listen
to her.

298
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:48,893
Dwight was in the ladies room,

299
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:50,437
and he was looking at me.
What?

300
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,022
This is not true.
He was looking at me

301
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,314
in the ladies' room.
That is totally unfair!

302
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,233
I was just in the ladies'
room in order to spy.

303
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,776
Dwight, Dwight, that--you've
hit an new low, my friend.

304
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,653
That's what I said! He was
spying in the ladies' room.

305
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,030
What do you think, Phyllis?

306
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,823
You think I followed
you in there like, "Oh good.

307
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,324
Phyllis is going
to the bathroom,

308
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,243
so maybe I get to see
her naked from the waist down."

309
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,745
I'm not even attracted to you.

310
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,371
That is a good point.

311
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,081
Write him up,
or I'll take it to Jan.

312
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,167
Okay, all right,
I will do that.

313
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,419
I will get to that definitely.

314
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:15,920
Absolutely.

315
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,673
When?
Oh, I don't know.

316
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,259
Maybe after I finish writing,
producing, directing,

317
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,346
and hosting your awards show,
all right?

318
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,806
Just relax,
keep your pants on.

319
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,600
Unless, of course,
you're in the bathroom

320
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,228
and you should be able to take
your pants off in that case

321
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,981
without Creepsville Central
spying on you.

322
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,861
Good.

323
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:44,157
The Dundie award
for longest engagement

324
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:46,951
goes to Pam Beesley.

325
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,913
Pam, everybody!
Yoo!

326
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,706
When is that girl
gonna get married?

327
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:53,750
That's what I have to say.
Aha, Roy's accepting.

328
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,502
Thank you, Roy, are there
any words you'd like to say

329
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,628
on Pam's behalf?

330
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,463
(Roy)
Uh, we'll see you next year.

331
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:03,176
(Michael)
Yeah! Oh, hope not!
Hope not.

332
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:04,761
I'm not changing that.
That's the best one.

333
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,346
No, it's hilarious.
You're right.

334
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:10,225
I just think, um,
World's Longest Engagement,

335
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,102
um, we're all expecting it,
you know?

336
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,561
That's why it's funny.

337
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,897
Every year that Roy and Pam
don't get married

338
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,399
it gets funnier.

339
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,275
Well, I think if you use
the same jokes,

340
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,194
it just comes across as lazy.

341
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:24,406
Oh. Lazy.

342
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:26,032
Uh-huh.

343
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:27,242
Excuse me, everyone.

344
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,868
Can I have your attention,
please?

345
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,663
I just wanted to say

346
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,957
that the women in this office
are terrible.

347
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,375
Especially the ones

348
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,918
who wrote that stuff
about Michael

349
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,461
on the bathroom wall.

350
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:40,422
Having a bathroom
is a privilege.

351
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:43,008
It is called a ladies' room
for a reason.

352
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:45,635
And if you cannot behave
like ladies,

353
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:48,972
well, then, you are not
going to have a bathroom.

354
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,849
You're taking away
our bathroom?

355
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,685
We are going to have
two men's rooms.

356
00:14:53,727 --> 00:14:55,311
But where would we--go?

357
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,605
Be prepared to hold it, folks.
Okay, okay.

358
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,940
From 9:00 a.m.--
Look.

359
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,316
(Pam)
Michael...
Yes?

360
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,776
Dwight's banning us
from our bathroom.

361
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:03,862
Okay, well, that's ridiculous.
So just don't--

362
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,321
I don't have time
for this right now.

363
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,199
There needs to be repercussions
for people's behavior.

364
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:11,453
Stop it! Stop it!
Okay.

365
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:13,788
Look, I know there have been
a lot of rumors flying around

366
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,457
about the Dundies this year,

367
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,460
how there is no money
and how there is no food,

368
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:21,254
and how the jokes
are really bad.

369
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:25,425
But, what the hell, everybody?
I mean--

370
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:31,890
God, the Dundies are about
the best in every one of us.

371
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,558
Can't you see that?
I mean--

372
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,896
Okay, we can do better.

373
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,815
(Michael)
So tonight,
for the first time,

374
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,361
we are inviting all of your
friends and family

375
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:46,404
to attend the awards
with us.

376
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,572
Yes.

377
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,282
(Michael)
Yeah, not bad, right?

378
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:52,243
So let's make this
the best Dundies ever.

379
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,079
[claps hands]
Best Dundies ever.

380
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,045
All right, let's wrap it up.
Come on, we're late.

381
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,880
The Dundies
are starting very soon.

382
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,132
Accounting, let's go, let's go.

383
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,385
Okay, I gave you fair warning.

384
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:10,887
Out. Who's next,
customer service?

385
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,389
Meredith, let's roll.

386
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:19,354
[siren, horn playing Reveille]

387
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:21,940
Welcome to the eighth annual
Dundies awards.

388
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,651
(Dwight)
Before we get started,
a few announcements.

389
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,778
Keep your acceptance
speeches short.

390
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,405
I have wrap-it-up music,

391
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,324
and I'm not afraid
to use it, Devon.

392
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:35,078
[Naughty By Nature's O.P.P.]

393
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,996
* Drop a load on 'em *

394
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:41,334
* *

395
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:42,836
[rapping]
* The Dundies *

396
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:43,962
* How can I explain it *

397
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,171
* Awards you and I created *

398
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,589
* I'm glad that
you all made it *

399
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:49,009
* You never have to work
so I don't hear no noises *

400
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,302
* You're just a name a number
and no one even says hello *

401
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,346
Card!
Come on.

402
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:56,975
The Dundies are kind of like
a kid's birthday party.

403
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:01,146
And you go, and there's really
nothing for you to do there.

404
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:03,356
But the kid's having
a really good time.

405
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,608
So you're kind of there.

406
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,819
That's--that's kind
of what it's like.

407
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,447
* Down with the Dundies *
* Yeah, you know me *

408
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,866
* You down with the Dundies *
* The Dundies *

409
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,285
* You down with the Dundies,
you're my homies *

410
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:17,370
I have listened to that song
so many times,

411
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,706
and I still don't know
what OPP stands for.

412
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:23,043
Other people's...

413
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,086
I--something--I--

414
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:27,464
* You down with the Dundies *

415
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,591
* You down with the Dundie-- *
[music stops]

416
00:17:29,632 --> 00:17:31,509
The waitress tripped
on the cord.

417
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,136
All right.
All right.

418
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:34,846
Joke landed.
So we are here.

419
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:39,559
Thank you all for coming
to the 2005 Dundie awards.

420
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:42,562
I am your host,
Michael Scott.

421
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:45,565
So, Pam, I wonder
who's gonna get

422
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,735
"longest engagement"
this year.

423
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,237
Well, you're not gonna get
longest engagement, man,

424
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:53,198
'cause we got that
locked up.

425
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,116
I wonder what I'll get.

426
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,247
I brought my fiancée.

427
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:04,334
And I just wanna tell you,
please, please,

428
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:06,336
do not drink and drive.

429
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,797
Because you may hit a bump
and spill the drink.

430
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,425
I'll just put these
on the group tab.

431
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,428
Nope, actually,
this year, no group tab.

432
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,222
We're gonna be doing
separate checks.

433
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,683
What?
Oh, great.

434
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,434
You said we could bring
our families.

435
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:25,689
I did, and why didn't you,
Stanley?

436
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,441
I did. My wife's
name is Teri.

437
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:30,777
Well, I'm looking forward
to meeting Teri.

438
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,904
It's this person whose hand
I'm holding, Michael.

439
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,449
[recorded deep voice]
Oh, yeah.

440
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:37,617
[whispers to Dwight]
Shut it.

441
00:18:37,659 --> 00:18:39,035
Um, good.

442
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,204
Speaking of relationships
of all--

443
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:43,790
all waves, shapes,
and forms,

444
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,583
um, I was out

445
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,460
on a very, very hot date
last night

446
00:18:47,502 --> 00:18:49,504
with a girl
from H.R., Dwight.

447
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,881
Really? We don't have
any girls from H.R.

448
00:18:51,923 --> 00:18:53,299
No, uh...

449
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:54,926
F-for the sake
of the story.

450
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,928
And things were getting
hot and heavy.

451
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,221
(Dwight)
Yeah?

452
00:18:58,263 --> 00:18:59,806
And I was about to take
her bra off,

453
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:02,892
when she had me fill out
six hours' worth of paperwork.

454
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,060
Like an AIDS test?

455
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,979
No.

456
00:19:06,021 --> 00:19:07,647
God.

457
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:09,024
(Michael)
Ahem!

458
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,526
All right, so let's get
this pahty stahted!

459
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,194
Hey, let's go
to Poor Richard's.

460
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,613
Yeah,
let's get out of here.

461
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:16,573
Um...

462
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,242
Guys, where are you going?

463
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:21,119
Pam,
show's just getting started.

464
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,620
Sorry.

465
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,498
[clears throat loudly]

466
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,417
And now to celebrate...

467
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:29,502
You staying?
Yeah.

468
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:32,255
Gotta eat somewhere.

469
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:36,176
The Busiest Beaver Award
goes to Phyllis Lapin!

470
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,927
Yeah!

471
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:41,681
Way to go, Phyllis.
Nice work. Per usual.

472
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:44,934
This says Bushiest Beaver.
What?

473
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,687
I told them busiest--
Idiots.
It's fine.

474
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,022
We can fix it.
We'll fix it up.

475
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,899
You don't have
to display that.

476
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,193
All right, our next award...

477
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:56,946
ah, yes, this award goes to

478
00:19:56,988 --> 00:20:00,533
the most creative writing
on the ladies' room wall,

479
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,744
and the winner is...

480
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,579
Who is it?

481
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,040
Who wants to claim it?
Shiny Dundie.

482
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,750
Who wrote it?

483
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:13,296
Great idea, Dwight.

484
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,215
Because that's what happens
every time!
He's a jackass!

485
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,424
Every year.

486
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,550
Come on, we're going
to Poor Richard's.

487
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,344
No, I don't wanna go.
I don't want to!

488
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:22,889
Pam, no.
If you would've asked me that,
then you would know.

489
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:26,351
[bad Asian accent]
Herro, everybody!

490
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:29,396
Hey...how are you?
I thought you left.

491
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,439
Um, no, I just--
I decided to stay.

492
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,400
Oh.
I'll just get a ride
home from Angela.

493
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:37,862
(Michael as Ping)
I going to call
the next award!

494
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:39,989
Oh, good, I'm just
in time for Ping.

495
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,492
Oh, that would be where?

496
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:46,538
Uh, me so horny, right?
You know what I'm talking about.

497
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,873
Can I get a drink?
(Michael as Ping)
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

498
00:20:53,128 --> 00:20:57,966
This next award goes to somebody
who really lights up the office.

499
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:01,928
Somebody who I think
a lot of us cannot keep

500
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,805
from checkin' out.

501
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:08,435
The Hottest in the Office Award
goes to...

502
00:21:08,476 --> 00:21:10,186
Ryan the temp!

503
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,897
* I believe in miracles *
Yeah!

504
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,192
* Hey, ho,
you sexy thing *

505
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:17,861
* Sexy thing you * *

506
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:18,945
Here you go.

507
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,448
[humming with music]

508
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,324
* Hangin' in
the huh nuh nuh ha *

509
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:26,036
* Come from, baby * *

510
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:27,954
There you go.
There you go, whoo!

511
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,874
What am I gonna do
with the award?

512
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:34,002
[scoffs]
Nothing.

513
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,838
I--I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

514
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,050
That's the least
of my concerns right now.

515
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,928
I think you're the hottest.

516
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:47,766
Thanks, Phyllis.

517
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,440
Thank you.

518
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,652
Ooh, my Reggae Sun Splash.

519
00:21:59,694 --> 00:22:02,447
I looked...so cool
ordering that.

520
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:03,948
[giggling] You want some?

521
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,575
No, thank you,

522
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,911
it's not really quite
pink enough for my tastes.

523
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,162
[Pam giggles]

524
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,374
Straw optional.

525
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:13,875
[both laughing]

526
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:17,295
Excuse me,
Goldschlager, extra flakes.

527
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:18,838
We don't have that.

528
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,423
You want
a Presidente Margarita?

529
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,008
Blue Pacific Margarita,
El Nino...

530
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,886
No, no. No margarita.
Hot sake.

531
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:29,099
Fosters in the big can.

532
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:35,146
Just a chocolate shake,
chocolate sprinkles.

533
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:44,114
(Michael)
And the Tight-Ass Award

534
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:45,615
goes to Angela.

535
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,618
Not only because she is
everybody's favorite stickler,

536
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,746
but because she has
a great caboose.

537
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:56,459
So, come on down.
No.

538
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:01,423
[laughs]

539
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:04,426
[slurps drink]

540
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:06,678
I think those
might be empty.

541
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,013
No, no, 'cause the ice melts,

542
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,098
and then it's like,
second drink.

543
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,433
[giggles]

544
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:14,060
Second drink?

545
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,770
(Michael)
The Spicy Curry Award

546
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,356
goes to our very own
Kelly Capour.

547
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,942
Get on up here.
[applause]

548
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:22,402
There you go.

549
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,195
"Spicy Curry."
What's that mean?

550
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:26,489
Um, not everything means
something, it's just a joke.

551
00:23:26,531 --> 00:23:28,199
Yeah, but why'd you
give it to me?

552
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,659
I don't know.
I just--

553
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:31,077
This is a bowler.
I know.

554
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,871
It's--they didn't have
any more businessmen.

555
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,123
Yeah, but I don't--
Just sit down, Kelly.

556
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,625
[heavy sigh]

557
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,962
It's so freaking hot in there.

558
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:42,547
Now I know what Bob Hope
was going through

559
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:43,506
when he performed
in Saudi Arabia.

560
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,133
Man!

561
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,052
I got Dwight sucking
the funny out of the room.

562
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,137
But, you know, you do
what you can do.

563
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,973
[piano playing]
Here we go,
he's early with the cue.

564
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,683
Gotta go.

565
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:58,188
[to the tune of Tiny Dancer]
* You have won a tiny Dundie *

566
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,148
Ow! Sing it, Elton!

567
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,941
Hey, thanks guys.

568
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,651
Hey, where're you guys from?

569
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,445
We just came
from your mama's house.

570
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:06,654
Are you guys gonna
finish that?

571
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,114
(Michael)
Oh, right, yeah!

572
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,241
(man at bar)
Sing another song, Dude.

573
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,743
Uh, you know what, guys?

574
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,244
We're just having a little
office party.

575
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,038
So if you wanna--
Hey!

576
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,247
You know, cool it guys,
really.

577
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:17,707
You suck, man.

578
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:20,335
You suck.

579
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:25,090
[Tiny Dancerplaying]

580
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,133
Let's cut it.
[music stops]

581
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:33,473
I had a few more Dundies
to give out tonight,

582
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:36,226
but I'm just gonna
cut it short

583
00:24:36,267 --> 00:24:38,103
and wrap it up

584
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:40,271
so everybody can
enjoy their food.

585
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:43,108
Um, thanks for listening,
those of you who listened.

586
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,984
[clears throat]

587
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:46,945
This last Dundie is for Kevin.

588
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,489
This is the Don't Go In There
After Me award.

589
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:52,200
It's for the time that I went
into the bathroom after him,

590
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:55,578
and it was really,
really smelly.

591
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:00,834
There you go.

592
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,591
Yay, Kevin!

593
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:11,052
Whoo hoo!
For Kevin!

594
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,555
For stinking up
the bathroom!

595
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:16,307
Yeah, all right, Kev!
Whoo!

596
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,226
Hey, I haven't gotten one yet.

597
00:25:18,268 --> 00:25:20,228
(Jim)
Yes, I have not
gotten one either.

598
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,480
So, keep going.
More Dundies!

599
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:24,691
Dundie.
Dundie.
Dundie.
Dundie.

600
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:28,278
[chanting continues]

601
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,904
All right, all right,
all right, okay.

602
00:25:29,946 --> 00:25:31,281
All right,
we'll keep it rolling.

603
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,408
Okay, this is
the Fine Work Award.

604
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,868
This goes to Stanley

605
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:37,412
for all the fine work
he did this year.

606
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:39,080
You know you did.

607
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:41,082
(Pam)
Hear, hear.

608
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:43,877
Speech, speech, speech,
speech, speech, speech...

609
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,838
Well, last year,
I got Great Work.

610
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,466
[drunken laugh]

611
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:51,885
So I don't know what
to think about this award.

612
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,928
But, at least I didn't get

613
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,722
Smelliest Bowel
Movement like Kevin.

614
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:57,932
[giggles]

615
00:25:57,974 --> 00:26:00,018
[light cheers and applause]

616
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:04,189
And this next award is going out
to our own little Pam Beesley.

617
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,066
I think we all know
what award

618
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:07,275
Pam is gonna be
getting this year.

619
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:10,695
It is
the Whitest Sneakers Award

620
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:15,283
because she always has
the whitest tennis shoes on!

621
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:17,577
Get on down here!

622
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,788
Pam Beesley,
ladies and gentlemen.

623
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:20,997
Ooh, here we go.

624
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:26,127
I have so many people to thank
for this award.

625
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:28,380
[laughs]

626
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,131
Okay, first off, my Keds,

627
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:32,342
because I couldn't have
done it without them.

628
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:34,844
Thank you.

629
00:26:34,886 --> 00:26:36,805
Let's give Michael
a round of applause

630
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,390
for emceeing tonight,

631
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:41,685
because this is a lot harder
than it looks.

632
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:44,562
And also because
of Dwight too.

633
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:48,149
Um, so, finally,

634
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:52,904
I wanna thank God
because God gave me this Dundie.

635
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:58,326
And I feel God
in this Chili's tonight.

636
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,245
Whoo!

637
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,330
Pammy B.,
ladies and gentlemen.

638
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:03,832
Oh, thank you.

639
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:06,710
Yeah!
Chair?

640
00:27:10,755 --> 00:27:13,091
Oh!

641
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:15,969
[sighs]
[sighs]

642
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:18,680
(Jim)
What a great year
for the Dundies.

643
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,390
We got to see Ping.

644
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:22,726
And we learned Michael's
true feelings for Ryan.

645
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:24,144
Which was touching.

646
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,980
And we heard Michael
change the lyrics

647
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,815
to a number
of classic songs.

648
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:31,443
Which for me,
has ruined them for life.

649
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:33,820
[Michael singing
I've Had the Time of My Life]

650
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:35,113
What?

651
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:36,656
Nothing.

652
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,116
Okay.

653
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:41,244
What?
I don't know, what?

654
00:27:42,537 --> 00:27:44,372
Oh, my God.

655
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:46,624
You are so drunk.

656
00:27:46,666 --> 00:27:47,876
Did you get that?
[Pam laughs]

657
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,002
Please tell me that you got--

658
00:27:49,044 --> 00:27:50,628
Vince, Vince!
Woman has had a seizure!

659
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,130
(Dwight)
Grab her tongue!
Grab her tongue!

660
00:27:52,172 --> 00:27:53,923
It's okay,
I'm a sheriff's deputy.

661
00:27:53,965 --> 00:27:55,467
Well, he's a volunteer.
Don't get into that now.

662
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,302
We need something
to cushion her head.

663
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,054
A throw pillow?
A cushion?

664
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,722
Okay, I'm gonna use my shirt.

665
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:02,390
Dwight, this is crazy.
Okay.

666
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,558
Jim, not now!

667
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,018
We need to cushion
her head.

668
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,353
Lie still. Please, Pam.

669
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,979
Do not move.
Dwight, Dwight.

670
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:08,897
I'm sorry.
[laughing] I am fine.

671
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,065
Jim, don't interfere.

672
00:28:10,106 --> 00:28:11,691
You have to put your clothes
back on.

673
00:28:11,733 --> 00:28:13,068
People are trying to eat.

674
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:14,277
Can you
give me a second, sir?

675
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,612
No!
Dwight, let me up.

676
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:16,738
Right now.

677
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,865
I am a Sheriff's Deputy.
That's fine.

678
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:20,617
I could have my men
in here in a second

679
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,118
and have you arrested.

680
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,411
Pam, are you all right?

681
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:24,704
I'm fine.
Sir, sir.

682
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:25,914
How many fingers
am I holding up?

683
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:27,248
You're holding up
three fingers.

684
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,084
Are you okay?
Put your clothes on, right now.

685
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:31,044
I will. I will.
You need to calm down.

686
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:32,420
Was this year's
Dundies a success?

687
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:33,922
Well, let me see.

688
00:28:33,963 --> 00:28:36,174
I made Pam laugh so hard that
she fell out of her chair.

689
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,093
And she almost
broke her neck.

690
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:39,719
So I killed.
Almost.

691
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:41,429
[laughs]

692
00:28:41,471 --> 00:28:42,514
Oh, my God!

693
00:28:42,555 --> 00:28:43,598
I just wanna say,

694
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,351
that this was the best
Dundies ever!

695
00:28:46,393 --> 00:28:48,269
Whoo!

00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:50,522
Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful, careful.

697
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,190
Don't wanna forget that.

698
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:54,526
You and your party
really need to leave right now.

699
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,569
Absolutely. Is this mine
or is this Chili's?

700
00:28:56,611 --> 00:28:58,029
I--
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

701
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,490
Keep it. My gift.
Thank you.

702
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:02,450
Have a good night.
See you next year.

703
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:04,077
That's...fine.

704
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:08,498
We have a strict policy here
not to over-serve.

705
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,959
(waiter)
Apparently this young woman
was sneaking drinks

706
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:12,419
off other people's tables.

707
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,587
I Xeroxed her
driver's license,

708
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:15,964
and she is not welcome

709
00:29:16,006 --> 00:29:17,632
at this restaurant
chain ever again.

710
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,092

711
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:20,593
Great work tonight.
Watch your step.

712
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:22,220
Excellent.
Thanks.

713
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:24,389
I had to, uh,
check her pupils

714
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:26,474
to make sure
that wasn't a concussion.

715
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,685
Yes, that too,
but I mean with the audio.

716
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:30,228
Great, great work.

717
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,484
I feel bad about what I wrote
on the bathroom wall.

718
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,611
No, you don't.

719
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:40,697
[laughs]

720
00:29:40,739 --> 00:29:43,324
Oh, here she is.

721
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:45,326
[sighs]
Careful, careful, whoa.

722
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:47,579
[laughs]
All right.
Easy.

723
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,539
Almost there.

724
00:29:49,581 --> 00:29:54,377
Hey, um, can I ask
you a question?

725
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,504
Shoot.

726
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:04,929
Um...I just wanted
to say thanks.

727
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:08,058
That's not really
a question.

728
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:10,226
Okay, let's get
you home, pronto.

729
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:12,687

00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:16,191
All right.
Bye.

732
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:17,734
Good night.
Have a good night.

733
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:19,694
Thank you, Angela.

People leaving without paying

739
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:46,429
and sticking me with a bill
for $400...

740
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:48,640
$400.

741
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:52,227
Making someone laugh
until they puke...

742
00:30:53,561 --> 00:30:55,647
Priceless.

743
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:57,357
My favorite Dundies moment?

744
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,778
I think it's when Angela
tied the cherry stem

745
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,988
with her mouth.

746
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,535
A couple of years ago,
I got an award

747
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:11,955
for tying a cherry stem
with my tongue.

748
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:14,082
I won't do that anymore.

749
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:17,043
She... she kinda went like...

750
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,885
It was pretty cool.

751
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,637
As for the bill, big deal.

752
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,141
People didn't pay, and I got
stuck with a tab for $400.

753
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:32,642
The joke is on them.

754
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:36,312
Do you realize how many
airline miles that is?

755
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:39,733

see you in Mardi Gras.

Good morning, Michael.

00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,008
What's going on?

6
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,551
Nothing.
You look nice today.

7
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,844
You look real thin.

8
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,596
Um...

9
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:58,016
Uh, I don't get
what you mean.

10
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,353
You just, um,
you look good.

Your shirt looks...
you look real good.

00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,317
Uh...

13
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,445
Well, you said I look thin,
so what does--

14
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:13,323
That mean I'm, like,
thin weird,

00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:16,701
or thin handsome, or...

16

Thin handsome, Michael.

00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,538
Ah.
Yes, well, of course.

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,915
Of course.

19
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,877
I'm in a good mood.
My mom is coming in to visit.

20
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,504
She lives, like, two hours away

21
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,255
and she doesn't have
a cell phone.

22
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,216
Which is cool
'cause it's kind of adding

23
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,051
some suspense to my day,

24
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,969

over at the door,

25
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,222

What?

00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,842
"Informing you that

Oh, phew, ro, rah!
Aaah!

Oh, this guy
is out of control.

ready for him.

Uh-oh!

Oh ho ho!

92
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:05,036
Todd Packer and I
are total BFF.

00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,371
Best friends forever.

94
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,457
He and I came up together
as salesmen.

95
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:14,838
One time we were out
and we met this set of twins.

96
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,800
And Packer told them
that we were brothers.

97
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,594
And so, you know,
one thing led to another.

98
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,556
And we brought 'em back
to the motel.

99
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,226
And then Packer
did both of them.

100
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,894
It was awesome.

00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,023
I was about
to close this order,

103
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,274
and it was
a really big one.

104
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,400
That's what she said.

00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,404
"That's what she said."

108
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,488
Please don't involve me
in this.

109
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,115
Nice!
That is a classic.

110
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,408
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh.

111
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,327
Okay, grade-A gossip
for you right now.

112
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,080
Randall, CFO, resigned.

113
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,206
Nobody knows why.

114
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,583
Are you kidding?

115
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,418
Everyone knows why!

116
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,253
You don't know?
Oh, okay, check this out.

117
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,838
All right,
so here's the story.

118
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,965
So Randall is nailing
his secretary, right?

119
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,925
And she's totally
incompetent.

120
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,552
Really?
Here we go.

121
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:05,013
Buckle up, it's gonna be
a bumpy one.

122
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:07,098
We're talking "blonde
incompetent," right?

123
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,183
Oh, yeah.

124
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,684
Like, uh,
ten words a minute.

125
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,144
Talking.

126
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:12,812
Well, to be fair,
blondes, brunettes.

127
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,356
You know, there are a lot
of dumb people out there.

128
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,066
They are women, right?

129
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,650
Oh, wow!

130
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,235
I didn't say it!
I didn't say it!

131
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,112
I said it.

132
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,407
And then, suddenly,
for no reason,

133
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:26,117
this bimbo asks
for a pay raise, right?

134
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,702
Really?

135
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,329
Yeah, and Randall's like,
"Uh, I'm not giving a pay raise

136
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,831
to someone whose
bra size is twice her IQ."

137
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,292
Oh, wow!
Some people don't test well.

138
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,960
Okay, I'm telling
the story.

139
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,088
So anyway, this bimbo
blows the whistle

140
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,799
on the whole thing
just to be a bitch.

141
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,134
Oh, wow, what'd I tell you
about the bleep button?

142
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,388
Hey, what has two thumbs
and hates Todd Packer?

143
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,640
This guy!

144
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,850
So, uh, what are you, uh,
what are you around?

145
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,268
You doing sales calls
in the area?

146
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,728
What's going on?

147
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,271
I meant to ask you,
you think you can get someone

148
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:58,149
to drive me around because of
the DUI situation?

149
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,276
Oh, bad boy.

150
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,612
Um, Ryan.

151
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:03,655
[makes quacking duck sound]

152
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,365
Come on, kid,
let's go.

153
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,658
Oh, man.

154
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,618
That Todd Packer
can do anything.

155
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,704
Except pass
that breathalyzer.

156
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,997
(Todd)
They key is,
when you get pulled over,

157
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,666
you just stall 'em
for as long as you can,

158
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,043
or you just start crying,
you know?

159
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:22,632
You a big
William Hung fan?

160
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,342
Why does everybody
ask me that?

161
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,844
Who the hell is that?

162
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,598
Wait, Jim, no.

163
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,684
Don't drink directly
from the can, okay?

164
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,144
I'm serious.
It's all over the Internet.

165
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,604
They use the same shipping
company as a rat poison,

166
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,565
and it gets on the can.

167
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,365
Well, you're an idiot.

168
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,952
What can I say, Dwight?
I live a very dangerous life.

169
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,295
[email chimes]

170
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:03,465
[monkey screeching]

171
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,633
[snickers]

172
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,386
Did you get that?

173
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,929
Yeah, I got it.

174
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,640
You could see her--
It's fake.

175
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,101
How do you know?
She wouldn't do that.

176
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,561
She's a senator.

177
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:20,982
[snickers]
Oh, that's funny.

178
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,117
Ow!

179
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,215
Hey.

180
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,759
Hey.

181
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,470
Whoa, a little early
for your 4:00 candy, isn't it?

182
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,180
Yeah, I know.
I'm just, like,

183
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,849
a little bit,
you know...

184
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,810
Gotcha.

185
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,482
I'm really excited
to meet your mom.

186
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:03,483
You are?

187
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:04,693
Yeah.

188
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,777
I'm excited
to show her around.

189
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,445
She really wants
to meet everybody.

190
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,488
Oh, yeah?
Good.

191
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,865
'Cause I have
a lot of questions.

192
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,409
Oh, really?
Yeah.

193
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,412
As a child did Pam
show any traits

194
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,621
that would hint towards
her future career

195
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,456
as a receptionist?

196
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,708
Oh, yes.

197
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,084
When Pam was
a little girl,

198
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,335
she used to answer
the phone

199
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,378
and press
the hold button

200
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,463
for hours,
every day.

201
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,756
That's incredible.

202
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,550
She was just
a natural.

203
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,719
[laughs]

204
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,014
Hey, send me that link
to the monkey sex video.

205
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,099
I'm going to forward it
like it's hot.

206
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:36,975
Yes!

207
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,643
* Forward it like it's hot *

208
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,395
* Forward it like it's hot *

209
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:41,938
Old school.

210
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,898
Michael?

211
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,025
Yes, Toby.

212
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,193
Um, I need to talk to you
in your office.

213
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,486
It'll just take two seconds.

214
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,196
[clears throat]

215
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,698
Um, literally two seconds?

216
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,158
Toby is in HR,

217
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:55,744
which technically means
he works for corporate.

218
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:59,414
So he's really not
a part of our family.

219
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,874
Also, he's divorced,

220
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,418
so he's really not
a part of his family.

221
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,961
The full story
is that Randall resigned

222
00:09:05,003 --> 00:09:06,629
because of
sexual harassment.

223
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,757
So corporate asked me
to do a five minute review

224
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,508
of the company's
sexual harassment policy.

225
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,052
No, no, Toby.
No.

226
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,178
It's really not
a big deal, Michael.

227
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,179
It is a big deal.

228
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,306
It's a big deal!

229
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,724
What are we supposed to do,

230
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:21,978
scrutinize every little thing
we say and do all day?

231
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,229
I mean, come on.

232
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,273
And then corporate
is gonna send in a lawyer.

233
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,483
What?
No!

234
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,651
Just to refresh you
on our policy.

235
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,153
What?
N-he--no.

236
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:33,406
Okay, what is a lawyer
gonna come in and tell us?

237
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,617
To not send out

238
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,535
hilarious emails
or not tell jokes?

239
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,995
Maybe not some of them.

240
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:40,872
Maybe not
inappropriate ones.

241
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,375
There is no such thing
as an appropriate joke.

242
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,043
That's why it's a joke.

243
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,252
Everyone?
Hello?

244
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,545
Everyone.
Hi.

245
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,047
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

246
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,591
I know you're all busy
and the last thing you want

247
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,510
is for a major
interruption.

248
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,554
But Toby has an announcement
that he insists on making

249
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,056
right now
in the middle of the day.

250
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,349
So take it away.

251
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,850
Yeah, okay.

252
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,561
Corporate would like us
to do a five minute review

253
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,271
of the company's
sexual harassment policy,

254
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,731
so I'll go over that later.

255
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,942
(Michael)
I wish you luck, Toby,
I really do.

256
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,902
But you are going to have
a mutiny on your hands.

257
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,614
And I just can't wait to see
how you handle it.

258
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,701
A guy goes
to a five dollar...

259
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,452
lady of the night.

260
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,247
And he gets crabs.

261
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,583
So the next day,
he goes back to complain.

262
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,502
And the woman says,

263
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,463
"Hey, it was only
five dollars.

264
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,299
What did you expect,
lobster?"

265
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,593
[laughs softly]

266
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,137
This is what's at stake.

267
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,309
Hey.
Hey.

268
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,436
I know we're having that

269
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,854
harassment thing
this afternoon.

270
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:46,938
Yeah.

271
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,023
Some times when we IM,

272
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,524
I send you that
little winking face

273
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,860
with the lipstick.

274
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,611
Yeah?
Yeah.

275
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,780
I realized that
might be harassment.

276
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,700
Yes,
it is harassment.

277
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:01,453
And I'm gonna be suing
the winking face.

278
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,954
I've hired the angry face
as my lawyer,

279
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,041
and you should be
hearing from him very soon.

280
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,959
Okay.
Okay.

281
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,633
[laughing]

282
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,347
[elevator bell]

283
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,474
Time to bring out
the big guns.

284
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,392
I am heading down
to the warehouse,

285
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,311
where jokes are born.

286
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,896
Find a killer joke
that'll just blow

287
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,482
everybody away
at the seminar later.

288
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,319
And remind them what is great
about this place.

289
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,446
So...ah!
Here they are.

290
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:39,032
Guys, wondering
if I could, uh,

291
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,492
get your help for something?

292
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,744
I am looking
for a new joke to tell.

293
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:44,662
And it needs to be
just killer.

294
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,040
And it does not
need to be clean.

295
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,041
So what you got?

296
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,417
Like, a joke?
A knock, knock joke?

297
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,669
Um, yeah--no.

298
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,961
I mean, better.
Better than that.

299
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,172
The type of stuff you guys
tell all day.

300
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:58,593
Well, those are some
awful tight pants you have on.

301
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:02,013
Where did you get 'em,
like, Queers 'R' Us?

302
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,473
Boys 'R' Us.

303
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,475
Oh!
All right, all right.

304
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,519
Well, yeah,
but you know.

305
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,896
A joke but not necessarily
at my expense.

306
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:11,898
Man, we can see
all your business

307
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,484
coming around the corner,
okay?

308
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:15,735
You need to, you know,
hide that.

309
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:17,028
Good thing you don't have
a lot of business

310
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,279
to start with.

311
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:20,532
Ohhhh, okay.

312
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,616
That was still about me.

313
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,867
Hey, hey, hey.

314
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,119
So you don't have
the biggest package.

315
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,662
Don't feel bad.
I don't feel bad.

316
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:26,871
I think he feels bad.

317
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:27,956
No, I don't.

318
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,040
You look like
you feel bad.

319
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,542
Okay, well...

320
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,710
You know, not exactly
what I was looking for.

321
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,461
But thanks, guys.
Thank you!

322
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,462
You look good in those pants.

323
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:35,588
He get it
from his mama!

324
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,717
[catcalling]

325
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,677
So, remember,
intent is irrelevant.

326
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,762
And that's it.
Pam.

327
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:46,516
Um, I just wanted to say
that--just,

328
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:48,226
my mom's coming in today.

329
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,602
Mmmmilf.

330
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,022
Thanks, Kevin.

331
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:54,232
Usually the day we talk about
sexual harassment

332
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,860
is the day that everyone
harasses me as a joke.

333
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,029
She's coming in today,
and maybe just don't joke

334
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,989
around about that stuff
in front of her?

335
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:02,032
Great point.

336
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,784
Uh, in fact, uh,
basic rule of thumb.

337
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,579
Let's just act every day
like Pam's mom is coming in.

338
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,081
All right, that's it.

339
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,916
If anybody has any questions
about anything,

340
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:13,585
you know where I sit
in the back.

341
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,129
[applause]

342
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:17,797
Hi, is it over?

343
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,257
Uh, yes.

344
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,842
No.
I know, I know.

345
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,510
It's good.
It is not over.

346
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,179
It is not over
'til it's over.

347
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,181
Did he tell you everything?

348
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,058
Obviously he didn't,

349
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,684
because you all still look
relatively happy,

350
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:32,103
albeit bored.

351
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:33,438
Do you realize
what we're losing?

352
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,606
Seriously.

353
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,274
Email forwards.

354
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,193
Exactly.
Mwah.

355
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,070
Can we afford to lose

356
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:42,572
email forwards?
Do we want that?

357
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,907
I hate them.

358
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,533
You send me these
filthy emails.

359
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,826
And you say,
"Forward them to 10 people,

360
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:48,620
or you'll have bad luck."

361
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,788
Give me a break.

362
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:54,209
Um, Stanley how about
that hot picture

363
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,044
you have by your desk?

364
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:58,004
The centerfold in the
Catholic schoolgirl's outfit?

365
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,215
I mean, it is hot,
it is sexy,

366
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,633
and it turns him on.

367
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:04,177
And I will admit,
best part of my morning

368
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,553
is staring at it.

369
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:07,138
But what, are we just
gonna take it away?

370
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,473
That is my daughter.

371
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,351
She goes to Catholic
girls' school.

372
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,353
Great!
He can leave it up!

373
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:14,896
I'm taking it down right now.

374
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,148
Leave it up, Stanley.
Leave it up!

375
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:19,025
Fight the good fight!

376
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,653
Um, what about
office romance?

377
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,488
Good point.
Yes.

378
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,657
Office romance.

379
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:28,660
For example,
Pam and I are dating.

380
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,495
Do we have to
disclose that?

381
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:31,788
We're not dating.

382
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,373
No, but I'm saying
hypothetically

383
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,666
if we were dating.

384
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,002
We're not dating.
I'm engaged.

385
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:40,714
Well, Roy is dead,
and I ask you out.

386
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:41,798
I would say no.

387
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,383
You say yes,
and we go out.

388
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:44,551
I would drown myself.

389
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,679
And now Roy and Pam
are dead,

390
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:50,598
and we have your
stupid rules to blame, Toby!

391
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,519
Office relationships
are never a good idea,

392
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,854
so let's just try
to avoid 'em.

393
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,939
But if you already have one,

394
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,566
you should disclose it
to HR.

395
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,526
Um, all relationships?

396
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,319
Even a one-night stand?

397
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:06,322
Uh, full disclosure.

398
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,325
Dwight and his electric pencil
sharpener are dating.

399
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,619
Uh, no, we're not.
Well, you said you hooked up.

400
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,246
Damn it, Dwight.
Okay, question.

401
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,248
When does this policy
go into effect?

402
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,332
Immediately.

403
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,792
[imitates buzzer]
Wrong, no.

404
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,253
New policies go into effect
next business day.

405
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:21,629
(Toby)
Okay, Dwight.

406
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,214
(Michael)
I think the old honor system
was fine.

407
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,051
For example, I have never
slept with an employee.

408
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,844
And believe me,
I could have.

409
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,220
Yeah, Meredith.

410
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:31,306
No, no, Catherine.
Remember her?

411
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,474
Remember how hot she was?

412
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:34,309
She would have definitely
slept with me.

413
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:35,727
She wasn't that hot.

414
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,521
Yes, she was.
Damn it, Kevin!

415
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,066
I'm in an office relationship.

416
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,650
It's special.

417
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,402
Mmm, she's nice,
she's shy.

418
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,446
She's actually here
if you wanna meet her.

419
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:50,158
Hold on a second.

420
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,285
Oh, my God.
Put on a shirt!

421
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,913
Put--I told you
that you'd be on camera.

422
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,748
I'm sorry, she's European.

423
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:59,959
No, I told you
that you'd be on camera.

424
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,294
Stop.

425
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,421
There really isn't
a problem here.

426
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,799
You are trying
to outlaw jokes.

427
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,300
Is that why you're
bringing in an attorney?

428
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:09,678
Is that--
he's bringing in a lawyer.

429
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,262
(Toby)
You know, some of these jokes,

430
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,890
you can just tell on your
free time with your friends.

431
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,850
Here's what he doesn't
understand.

432
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,852
This is our free time.

433
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,896
These are our friends.

434
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:24,192
And I think we have a right
to make our own rules.

435
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,778
I saw the most hilarious
monkey sex video

436
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,364
on the Internet this morning
with Michael.

437
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:31,783
I don't want things like that
to change.

438
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,494
What if Pam was a lesbian?

439
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:38,164
What if she brought
her "partner" into work?

440
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,624
Would that be
crossing the line?

441
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,126
No.

442
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,836
What if they made out
in front of everybody?

443
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:45,171
Well, that would be--
At home?

444
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:49,342
And I told everybody
everything about it?

445
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:50,301
Okay, I'm lost.

446
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,511
Okay.

447
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:52,554
Well, then,
let's act it out.

448
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,305
Pam, you will be girl A.

449
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:57,475
And girl B will be...

450
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,311
Okay, we'll use the doll.

451
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,438
Pam?

452
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,232
Pam?

453
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,988
I wish Todd Packer was here,
'cause he would love this.

454
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,823
I wonder if anybody else
would like to join us.

455
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:13,700
Oop.
Coming out of my mouth.

456
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:17,328
Hey, um,
we have to watch Toby's video

457
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,329
that he's showing us

458
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,914
in order to brainwash us.

459
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,500
And I was wondering
if anybody'd like to join in?

460
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,501
Gonna be fun.

461
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,919
Got microwave pizza.

462
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,047
What do you say?
Jim?

463
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,673
No, thanks, I'm good.

464
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:32,093
That's what she said.
Pam?

465
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:33,928
Um, my mother's coming.

466
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,513
That's what she said--
[clears throat]

467
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:37,015
No, but--okay.

468
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,391
Well, suit yourself.

469
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,144
Hey, Toby.

470
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:42,187
Hey, Dwight.

471
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,730
You said that we could
come to you

472
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:45,148
if we had any questions.

473
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,274
Sure.

474
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:50,904
Where is the clitoris?

475
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:59,162
On a website it said
on the crest of the labia.

476
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,167
What does that mean?

477
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:09,381
What does the female vagina
look like?

478
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,883
Technically, I am
in human resources.

479
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:15,053
And Dwight was asking
about human anatomy.

480
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:19,557
Um, I'm just sad
the public school system

481
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,810
failed him so badly.

482
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,061
You know,
maybe when you get

483
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,938
really comfortable
with each other,

484
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,524
you can ask for that.

485
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:29,526
Good.

486
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,735
Good.
And--

487
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,570
I should get back to work.

488
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,197
Okay.

489
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,282
In today's fast-paced
business climate,

490
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,076
it can sometimes
be hard to know

491
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,579
when a comment or an action
crosses the line.

492
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,456
Let's take a look
at a couple of scenarios

493
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:45,000
and ask ourselves,

494
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:47,460
where is the line?

495
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:50,880
The natural redhead.

496
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,298
Hey, Marie.

497
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,508
Hey, Joe, Mike.

498
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,010
Hey, settle a bet.

499
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,470
Are you a natural redhead?

500
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,681
[laughter]

501
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,975
Nah, she ain't red.
No, none of them are, man.

502
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:03,935
What does that even--
how does that even bad,

503
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,604
asking if you're a redhead?

504
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,065
Oh my--hey, stop the video!

505
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,067
Wait, go--stop it right there.
Stop it right there.

506
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,989
That's that girl
from that thing.

507
00:19:16,031 --> 00:19:17,449
I banged this girl
right here.

508
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,658
That's her?

509
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,826
Yes, this is the one.
You remember...

510
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,286
No, the party?
You banged her?

511
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,538
Right here.
You are a naughty girl.

512
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,622
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

513
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,790
Okay, hypocrite.

514
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,625
Okay, she is a hypocrite.

515
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,836
That is such a scam.
Okay.

516
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,296
Yes?

517
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,756
Yes, I did.

518
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:33,965
Okay.

519
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:35,508
Well, we can talk
about that later then.

520
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,926
Okay, you are never
gonna believe this.

521
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:38,136
The girl in the video

522
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,637
we're watching
that corporate gave us.

523
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,306
Darryl banged her!

524
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,436
And...

525
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:48,855
He's about 90% sure.

526
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:55,028
Don't ever let this
little bitch

527
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,237
drive you around town.

528
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,489
We got lost
for half an hour.

529
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,532
I don't have any DUIs,
so l can drive myself.

530
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:00,825
But thanks.

531
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,369
Where is Michael Snot?

532
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,580
Sniffing some dude's thong?

533
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:08,166
Probably.

534
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,835
So you are the lawyer,
Mr. O'Malley.

535
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,170
I know a lot
of lawyer jokes.

536
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:13,546
I love lawyer jokes.

537
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:16,466
Well, it's probably because
you don't get 'em.

538
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,635
When I said before
that I was king of forwards,

539
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,887
you gotta understand
that I don't

540
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,138
come up with this stuff.

541
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,433
I just forward it along.

542
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,268
You wouldn't arrest a guy
who's just delivering drugs

543
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,562
from one guy to another.

544
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:30,939
You seem a little bit
agitated, Michael.

545
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,232
What's the problem?

546
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:35,151
The problem is that...

547
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,444
I am the boss.

548
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,655
And apparently
I can't say anything.

549
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:43,034
Well, that's--that's true
in a way.

550
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,704
You can't say "anything."

551
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:46,788
Where's the line?

552
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,956
Where's the line, Jan?

553
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,499
Do you need to see
the video again, Michael?

554
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,042
No, I've seen the video.
He talked the whole time.

555
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:53,378
No, I didn't.

556
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,547
[sighs]
What?

557
00:21:00,552 --> 00:21:02,595
Attention, everyone.
Hello?

558
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:04,806
Uh, yes, I just want you
to know that, uh,

559
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,349
this is not my decision.

560
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:11,312
But from here on out,
we can no longer be friends.

561
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:15,316
And when we talk about
things here,

562
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:19,904
we must only discuss
work associated things.

563
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:24,325
And you can consider this
my retirement from comedy.

564
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:27,120
And in the future, if I want
to say something funny,

565
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,539
or witty,
or do an impression,

566
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:34,794
I will no longer ever
do any of those things.

567
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:37,964
Does that include,
"That's what she said"?

568
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,133
Mm-hmm, yes.

569
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,302
Wow, that is really hard.

570
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,513
Do you really think
you can go all day long?

571
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:51,353
Well, you always left me
satisfied and smiling, so...

572
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,105
That's what she said!

573
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:55,648
Michael...

574
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,025
Michael!

575
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:58,068
Michael, please.

576
00:21:58,109 --> 00:21:59,110
There he is!

577
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,528
Mwah!

578
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,613
(Packer)
Come on!

579
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,822
You would have done the same.

580
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:04,449
You just didn't
think of it first.

581
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,242
Mi-Michael, please.
I-I--really.

582
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,911
That's not
my sense of humor.

583
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:09,454
Okay.
Hello.

584
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:10,830
Jan, Mr. O'Malley,

585
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:14,250
this is my lawyer
James P. Albini.

586
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:15,794
I believe you may
recognize his face

587
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,504
from the billboards.

588
00:22:17,545 --> 00:22:20,298
He specializes
in free speech issues.

589
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,842
And motorcycle head injuries,
worker's comp,

590
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,260
and diet pill lawsuits.

591
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,345
This guy does it all.

592
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:26,805
Excuse me,
I'm sorry.

593
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,349
Michael, Mr. O'Malley
is your lawyer.

594
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,685
What?

595
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,562
Mr. O'Malley
is our corporate lawyer.

596
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:37,357
We have him on retainer
to protect the company,

597
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:39,025
as well as upper level
management

598
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,360
such as yourself.

599
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:43,905
So I'm not in trouble?

600
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,741
I am so used to being
the bad boy.

601
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,536
I am so used
to fighting corporate

602
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,204
that I forget
that I am corporate.

603
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,665
Upper management.

604
00:22:53,707 --> 00:22:55,875
They hooked me up
with an attorney.

605
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:58,712
To protect me.

606
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:02,215
You can't be too careful
about what you say.

607
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,718
Mo' money, mo' problems.

608
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,554
Okay, well, let's get you
out of here, James.

609
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,556
Um, I think
we're under an hour still.

610
00:23:09,597 --> 00:23:11,641
Yeah, but I did a lot
of paperwork at home.

611
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:13,018
We'll talk about it later.

612
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,019
Thanks for coming in.

613
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:18,606
Is William Hung here?

614
00:23:24,863 --> 00:23:26,448
Um, hello.

615
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:28,116
Oh, my God!

616
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:29,617
I finally made it.

617
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:30,493
Hello!

618
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,746
I love my mom.

619
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:36,666
Okay, that's probably the
most obvious statement ever.

620
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,585
Okay,
so when do I get to

621
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,211
actually meet
all these people?

622
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:41,629
Um...

623
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:42,714
Bear says to the rabbit,
"Hey, it stick to your fur?"

624
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:43,923
He goes, "No."
He says, "Good."

625
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,426
Why don't we just, like,
stay here for a while,

626
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,053
and I'll show you
my desk.

627
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,637
Okay.
This is all yours?

628
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,930
Yeah, I am in charge
of this whole area.

629
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:52,724
Oh, my goodness.
That's great.

630
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:04,986
I think we are done with her
for a while.

631
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:11,326
Um, this is my picture of us
at Aunt Millie's barbeque.

632
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:12,786
The one that you, um...

633
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,621
Remember the one you said
I should get blown up?

634
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,456
So a guy goes home,
tells his wife,

635
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:18,750
"Honey, pack your bags,
I just won the lottery."

636
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,460
She goes, "Oh, my God.
That's incredible.

637
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:21,836
Where are we going?"

638
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:23,254
He goes, "I don't know
where you're going,

639
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,048
just be out of here by five."

640
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:27,384
[laughter]

641
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:30,178
Boom!

642
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,847
Why does he call her honey
if he hates her so much?

643
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:35,600
Doesn't she get half of his
money because they're married?

644
00:24:35,642 --> 00:24:37,310
It's a joke, lurch.

645
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:39,229
This is where
I used to keep my computer.

646
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,689
Oh, right, I remember.

647
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,065
With the picture, yeah.

648
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:44,818
But I switched stuff around
because I actually needed,

649
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:47,320
like, more room
for organization.

650
00:24:47,362 --> 00:24:49,823
This is, like, um...

651
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:52,325
Oh, there he is.

652
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,952
How are you?
Hey, handsome.

653
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,912
You look great.
Oh, thank you.

654
00:24:55,954 --> 00:24:57,664
So, we ready for dinner?

655
00:24:57,706 --> 00:24:59,874
Well, you know,
actually I kind of need to

656
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:01,001
stall a bit.

657
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:02,419
But it's okay,

658
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,713
because I am very used
to killing time.

659
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,172
Oh, I don't believe that.

660
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:07,841
Okay, I'm gonna go wait
in the parking lot.

661
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:10,301
And what kind of tunes
do you want for the ride?

662
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:11,428
A little classical,
a little oldies?

663
00:25:11,469 --> 00:25:13,847
Oh, anything is fine.

664
00:25:13,888 --> 00:25:16,516
All right,
well, see ya.

665
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:20,937
(whispered)
So which one is Jim?

666
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,981
(whispered)
Mom!

667
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,232
I just wanted to know.

668
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:25,775
No, it's...
All right, okay.

669
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:27,736
10 minutes,
then we can go to dinner.

670
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:29,112
I'll make myself busy.

671
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:30,155
There's this guy,

672
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,990
he's at a nymphomaniac
convention.

673
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:33,324
And he is psyched,

674
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,660
'cause all these woman
are smoking hot perfect 10s,

675
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:37,662
except for this one chick
who looks a lot like...

676
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:39,581
Phyllis?
Yeah.

677
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:41,624
No, no, no.
That crosses the line.

678
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:42,834
Ex-squeeze me?

679
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:46,129
Not you.

680
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:49,591
Kevin.
Just unwarranted.

681
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,092
Hostile work environment,
Kevin.

682
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:52,344
Packer said it.

683
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:53,678
No, you said it.

684
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,805
He pointed.
A point is not a say.

685
00:25:55,847 --> 00:26:00,018
Look, Kevin,
we are a family here.

686
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,020
And Phyllis is a valued
member of that family.

687
00:26:02,062 --> 00:26:03,229
Like a grandmother.

688
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:04,272
I'm the same age
as you, Michael.

689
00:26:04,314 --> 00:26:05,523
I don't know about that.

690
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:06,566
We're the same
high school class.

691
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:07,776
Well, I have a late birthday

692
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:10,278
and usually September
is a cutoff point...

693
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,363
You know what?

694
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:13,573
You just crossed the line,
okay?

695
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,617
There is a line
and you went over it.

696
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:19,329
And you must be punished.
So go to your corner.

697
00:26:19,371 --> 00:26:21,081
You mean
where my desk is?

698
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:22,248
Yes, your corner.
Go.

699
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,417
Okay.

700
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:25,919
I have a lot of work
to do, anyway.

701
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,754
(Packer)
Oh, my.

702
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,131
They really got to you,
didn't they?

703
00:26:30,173 --> 00:26:32,384
They didn't get to me.

704
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:33,843
I got to them.

705
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,515
I am still
the same old Michael Scott.

706
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:41,309
New and improved.

707
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:42,519
You know what?

708
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,813
I love Phyllis.

709
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,108
You know what else?

710
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:50,151
I think she is gorgeous.

711
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:55,365
I think she is an incredibly,
incredibly attractive person.

712
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,282
Come here.
Give me a kiss.

713
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:57,575
Come on.

714
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,244
Michael, come on,
you don't have to worry.

715
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,870
I'm not gonna...
I'm not worried.

716
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:03,540
report you to HR.
You know what?

717
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,458
The only thing
I am worried about

718
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,502
is getting a boner.

719
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:10,880
Good work today,
everybody.

720
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,595
Times have changed
a little.

721
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,180
[inhales deeply]

722
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:20,849
And even though
we're still a family here

723
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,185
at Dunder Mifflin,
families grow.

724
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:25,770
And at some point,

725
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:30,400
the daddy can't take a bath
with the kids anymore.

726
00:27:30,442 --> 00:27:31,735
I am upper management.

727
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:34,654
And it would be inappropriate
for me

728
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:37,032
to take a bath
with Pam.

729
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:39,451
As much as I
might want to.

730
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:40,618
He said what?

731
00:27:44,622 --> 00:27:48,793
Toby actually gets alimony
from his ex-wife

732
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:51,296
because she makes more.

733
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:54,341
So that's kind of embarrassing.

734
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:57,135
Not that I'd mind,
but it would never happen to me

735
00:27:57,177 --> 00:27:59,095
because I would make
the marriage work.

736
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,597
People seem to like him

737
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:03,016
because I think he's one of us,
but he's not.

738
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:08,605
He's this weird loner
who just tells people,

739
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:09,898
"Don't do this, don't do that.

740
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,649
Hire this person
for this reason."

741
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:12,859
[mouths words]

742
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,235
I would complain about him,

743
00:28:14,277 --> 00:28:17,489
but who would I go to
to complain about Toby?

744
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,325
Toby.
Bias.

745
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,035
And what does he do about that?
Nothing.

746
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,286
Because he's Toby.

747
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,997
What kind of name is that?

748
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:28,416
It's almost a girl's name.

749
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:33,755
I think I've known more girls
named Toby than guys.

750
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:37,008
He just kind of makes my skin
crawl a little bit.

751
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:40,053
Toby is the devil.

752
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:41,888
Toby's the devil.

753
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,265
So I'm not a big Toby fan.

1
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:14,139
(Michael)
I'm an early bird,

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,306
and I'm a night owl.

3
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,934
So I'm wise
and I have worms.

4
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,811
Now.
[knocking on door]

5
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,604
Oh! Breakfast.

6
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,398
I got you your sausage,
egg, and cheese biscuit.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,444
Yummy, yummy.
Thank you, Ryan.

8
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:31,823
What was the thing you
needed me to come in early for?

9
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,491
Um...

10
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,785
the sausage, egg,
and cheese biscuit.

11
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:39,914
But thank you,
and why don't you just...

12
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,166
Take a couple of hours.

13
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,334
Office is yours.

14
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,295
Home Alone,
Risky Business.

15
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:48,882
Take your pants off,
run around.

16
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,508
Whatever you wanna do.

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,844
I'm just gonna take a nap
in my car till work starts.

18
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,803
Okay.

19
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,932
See? Healthier.

20
00:00:57,974 --> 00:01:00,477
Gotta watch those carbs.

21
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,105
Hey.

22
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,692
(Jim)
Oh, Pam, can I see you
in here for a second?

23
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:10,528
It's important, so...

24
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,115
Okay.

25
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:20,497
What?

26
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,873
What is this?

27
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,376
I found Dwight's wallet
in the parking lot.

28
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,960
Oh, my God,
what are we gonna do?

29
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,337
I don't know, I don't know.

30
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,297
I don't know
what the best play is.

31
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,965
Do we tear everything up,

32
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,219
or do we buy a horse
on the internet?

33
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,595
I mean,
I don't know what to do.

34
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,888
What do you think?

35
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,056
I know.
I know what to do.

36
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,391
Okay, what?

37
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:42,143
Okay, put everything back
exactly how you found it.

38
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,354
Okay.

39
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:52,404
Hey, Dwight, Jim and I found
your wallet in the parking lot.

40
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,117
What did you do to it?

41
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,618
Nothing.

42
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:02,163
I'm serious.
What did you do to it?

43
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,750
Dwight, I swear,
we didn't do anything.

44
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,094
Nice try.

45
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,471
Cancel card.

46
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:25,145
Cancel...card.

47
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:34,112
Cancel card.

48
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,115
[piano rock]

49
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:44,205
* *

50
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,150
Today I, Michael Scott,
am becoming a homeowner.

51
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,443
Investing in real estate.

52
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:14,694
Diversifying.
Smart.

53
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,530
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.

54
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,241
It is very important
to own property.

55
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,826
Back in olden days,

56
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,245
they would not even
let you vote

57
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,622
unless you owned property.

58
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:28,208
They'd throw you in the stocks
and humiliate you.

59
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,250
And it worked.
Yes.

60
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,251
We should bring
the stocks back.

61
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,294
People will obey the law.

62
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,379
There'd be less troublemakers.

63
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,381
Maybe.
[laughs]

64
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,049
So what are the specs?
What?

65
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:39,094
What are the specs?
Oh, okay, I'll tell you.

66
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,637
Let's see here.

67
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:42,097
Three bedroom, two bath
contemporary townhouse...

68
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,556
Nice.

69
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,517
Two-car parking...
Yes.

70
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,477
Wall-to-wall carpet...
God, what a steal!

71
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,728
All fixtures included.

72
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,107
Yes, this is looking good.

73
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,235
Does it have a deck?

74
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,403
I think it does.

75
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,155
Have you seen it?
Yes.

76
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,907
Does it have a deck?

77
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,034
I think it has a--yeah,
it has a deck.

78
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,078
They call it a porch,
but it is a deck.

79
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,580
When a man is laying
on his deathbed,

80
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,749
there are four things that go
through his mind.

81
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,670
Was I well-loved?
Check.

82
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,588
Did I express myself?

83
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,424
Did I let my light shine
through?

84
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,009
Check.

85
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,386
Will an attractive woman cry
at my funeral?

86
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:25,306
Check--probably more than one.
Check, check, check, check.

87
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,436
Lastly, did I achieve success
and own real estate?

88
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,062
And when I close on this condo,

89
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:35,025
I will be able
to check that one as well.

90
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,652
[sighs]

91
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:45,201
(Pam)
Every so often,
Jim dies of boredom.

92
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,954
I think today it was
the expense reports

93
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,456
that did him in.

94
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,790
And, uh, our deal is

95
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:53,043
that it's up to me
to revive him.

96
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,170
You see Dwight's coffee mug?
Mm-hmm.

97
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,379
Sometimes when he's not here,

98
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,131
I try to throw stuff in it.

99
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,633
No way.
[laughs]

100
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,427
Let's do this.

101
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,846
[crumpling paper]

102
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:07,640
Oh!

103
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,227
Here.
Try paper clips.

104
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,146
Oh, wait.
This message.

105
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,147
For Dwight.

106
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,607
Perfect.

107
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:19,486
Uh!
Oh!

108
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,364
I love it, I love it.
What do you call it?

109
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,615
Schrute ball.

110
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:24,949
How about Skeet Schruting?

111
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,493
Did you just come up
with that?

112
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,828
Mm-hmm.
That is good.

113
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,205
That's it.
That's what it is.

114
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,374
Thank you.

115
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:36,294
Oh, somebody went in.

116
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,088
That was a team effort, Pam.

117
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,965
Oh!

118
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,843
I mean,
you've got stuff here.

119
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,972
You rented "Mermaids."
You can't--it's a movie.

120
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,641
You can't deduct that.
You know that.

121
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,226
(Angela)
It's not an office expense.

122
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,602
Yes, thank you.

123
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:56,815
Next year you should file
your stuff in a basket.

124
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,317
Remember, last year
he slipped by with "Stripes."

125
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,277
He put--he rented "Stripes,"
he had it for a week,

126
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,904
and that got through,
so maybe he's thinking

127
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,115
he can do that from now on.

128
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,324
Please.

129
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:09,369
Maybe he can file his things
in a paper bag.

130
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,539
That's not helping, Angela.
That's not helping him.

131
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,916
Homeowner.

132
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,044
About to join
an exclusive club, Dwight.

133
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,213
Maybe someday these people
out here will know

134
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,881
what that feels like.

135
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,135
Maybe not, who knows?
Not my problem.

136
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,219
You should go.

137
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,470
Yes. Yes.

138
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,680
Final walkthrough.
Mm-hmm.

139
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,889
Sign the papers
at the condo.

140
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,307
You have your lawyer there?

141
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,892
Uh, I don't need one.
Can I be your representative?

142
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,728
I don't need a representative.
I think I should be there.

143
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:35,937
No, no.
No, I'm good.

144
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:36,980
I can make sure
things are up to code.

145
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,314
No, Dwight. I'm fine.
Please?

146
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:39,941
I'm always the guy
that you rely on at work.

147
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:40,942
Well, this isn't about work.

148
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,444
This is closing on a condo.

149
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,611
It's completely personal.

150
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,530
So you're taking
a personal day?

151
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,698
[clears throat]

152
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,782
Except that

153
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,367
this is about
my living arrangement,

154
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,785
and as boss,

155
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,746
I need to have
a living arrangement

156
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,080
in order to do work.

157
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,457
Please?

158
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll make you proud.

159
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,793
Okay, fine.
Yes, you can come.

160
00:06:58,835 --> 00:06:59,753
Yes!
As your representative?

161
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:00,837
As my associate.

162
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,089
Same thing.
No, it is not.

163
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:06,468
Why don't you bring some work
that we can do in the car

164
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,345
and some Lunchables as snacks.

165
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,512
Lunchables are a whole lunch.

166
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,680
Just bring it.

167
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,349
I have been
Michael's number two guy

168
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,267
for about five years.

169
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,894
And we make a great team.

170
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,271
We're like one of those
classic, famous teams.

171
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,189
He's like Mozart,

172
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,984
and I'm like...Mozart's friend.

173
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:23,860
No.

174
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,029
I'm like Butch Cassidy,

175
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:29,657
and Michael is like Mozart.

176
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,868
You try and hurt Mozart,

177
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,745
you're gonna get
a bullet in your head

178
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,789
courtesy of Butch Cassidy.

179
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,958
[in mocking Asian accent]
Oh, most honorable Pamera.

180
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,128
Not offensive because that's
the way they talk in movies.

181
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,588
You headed out?
Uh, we are.

182
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,048
Dwight and I are going
to the big thing.

183
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,509
So why don't you have everybody

184
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,885
work on their expense reports,

185
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,845
and I'd like them in
by the end of the day.

186
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,055
Okay.
Very good.

187
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,348
Have a great time.
We will.

188
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,391
Um, did you do the thing

189
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,767
I asked you to do
about the magazines?

190
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,227
Yeah, I changed them
to your new address.

191
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,603
Good. The...

192
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,689
Small Businessman?
Yep.

193
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,191
Maxim?
American Way?

194
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,150
Cracked?

195
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,527
Yes.

196
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,405
I changed your Cracked
magazine subscription.

197
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,157
How about m--uh,

198
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,329
Fine Arts...
Aficionado Monthly?

199
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:17,539
No? Okay.

200
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,832
Well, could you get on that?

201
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,542
'Cause I don't
just read Cracked.

202
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,835
[sighs]
Thank you.

203
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,922
Okay.
See you soon.

204
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,882
What is he so excited about?

205
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,509
Michael's closing
on his condo today.

206
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,302
Ah.

207
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,887
Yesterday he asked me
if I'd go with him

208
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,597
as his associate.

209
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,599
And you said no?
Yeah.

210
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:40,937
He also asked me if I would cry
at his funeral.

211
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,149
What kind of shocks
you got on this baby?

212
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,860
I don't know.
Regular, normal ones.

213
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,195
Nothin' fancy.

214
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,989
Not my style.

215
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,407
What are you doin'?

216
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,616
I wanna put the top down.

217
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,201
No, Dwight.
It's 50 degrees outside.

218
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,202
Don't--Please.

219
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,038
Yeah, but then
no one can see us.

220
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,373
I--Just, would you
put it up?

221
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,667
Okay. Fine.

222
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,127
Just leave it down.

223
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,421
Whiner.

224
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,214
Check it out.

225
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,966
Terminator.

226
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:13,178
I do not understand
what you spend your money on.

227
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,721
Ooh.

228
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:15,847
(Jim)
Hey, Oscar.

229
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,057
On these new expense reports,

230
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,017
do we really have to go back
to last quarter?

231
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,018
Yeah.

232
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,644
It's a terrible system,
I know.

233
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,063
What?

234
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,565
What does "2005 season" mean?

235
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:26,733
Tha--[laughs]

236
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,234
Wait a minute.
What is this?

237
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,194
It's a scoreboard.

238
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,779
What?

239
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,572
Kevin and I play
this paper football game

240
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:33,740
when Michael's out.
Really?

241
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:34,866
Yeah.
Or when we're bored.

242
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,701
Oh, my God!

243
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,620
Wait, this goes back
two years!

244
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,705
We're bored a lot.

245
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,582
Oh-ho.
Oh!

246
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,584
Sweet.
Yes!

247
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:46,086
So close.

248
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,587
I really love the, uh,

249
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,090
paper triangle flicking
and hitting things game.

250
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,716
Yeah.
We call it Hateball.

251
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,093
Why?

252
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,970
Because of how much
Angela hates it.

253
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,306
Hey, do you guys have
any other games?

254
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,474
Sometimes we play

255
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:01,893
Who Can Put the Most m&ms
in Their Mouth?

256
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,603
(Angela)
You play that.

257
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:04,896
You should ask Toby

258
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,857
to teach you Dunderball.

259
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,360
Home sweet home.

260
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,237
Which one's yours?

261
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,738
Right there.

262
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,281
My sanctuary.

263
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,784
My party pad.

264
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,244
Someday I can just see

265
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,287
my grandkids

266
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,832
learning how to walk
out here.

267
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,960
Hang a swing
from this tree.

268
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:30,088
Push 'em back--

269
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,214
Wait.

270
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,633
No, it's this one
right here.

271
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,135
Home sweet home.

272
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,594
So it's like volleyball.
Okay.

273
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,138
Okay, you're gonna want to take
a hold of the ball.

274
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,973
Mm-hmm.
And you bounce it off

275
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,975
the wall
on your side of the tape.

276
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,852
Oh, okay--oh, so that's
what the tape's for.

277
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,812
I didn't know.

278
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,313
Yeah,
Michael asked about it once,

279
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,607
and I just pretended
not to hear him.

280
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,651
He left.

281
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,445
All right, let's play.

282
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,904
Kelly, do you mind
if I use your desk?

283
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,906
Yeah, go ahead.

284
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,074
Extra points
if you break his monitor.

285
00:10:58,116 --> 00:10:59,325
Is that true, Toby?

286
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,660
It's not true.

287
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:02,120
It's my monitor.

288
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:05,540
And I'll just take Kelly's.

289
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,791
(Kelly)
Nice.

290
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,168
This is all mine.

291
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,878
All the way down,
around the corner.

292
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,338
It's a shared space,

293
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,380
but I can use it
whenever I want to.

294
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,215
Okay, so I called in
a favor

295
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:15,300
to my buddy
at the police department...

296
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,135
Ah, the volunteer
sheriff's station.

297
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,762
Same thing.
No.

298
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,305
Um, these are
the crime statistics

299
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,098
for the surrounding square mile
over the past four years.

300
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,266
Oh, anything bad?

301
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,143
Two charges of loitering.
Mm-hmm.

302
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,811
One noise complaint.

303
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,813
Several speeding tickets.
Mm-hmm.

304
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,607
Do you own a gun?
No.

305
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,233
I'd think about it.
Mm--I don't need a gun.

306
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:35,737
Hello?
Hello! How are you?

307
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,405
Okay.
I'm, uh, just about to close

308
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,324
on 126 over there.

309
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,034
And I guess
we're gonna be neighbors.

310
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:42,869
Very cool. Very cool.

311
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:44,871
So, uh--so what's the vibe?

312
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:46,373
What's the vibe
of this place?

313
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:48,375
Uh, I don't know.
It's pretty quiet.

314
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,335
Oh, rea--wow.
Ooh, that's gonna change.

315
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,961
[laughs]

316
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,046
Why?

317
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,675
Because...I loves to party.

318
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,553
And I'm gonna be partying my
butt off at this place.

319
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,556
Okay, but there's
an 11:00 noise curfew.

320
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:04,891
Hi, I'm Dwight Schrute,

321
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,059
Mr. Scott's associate.

322
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,061
Who's Mr. Scott?
Him.

323
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,562
I have a question
about the property line.

324
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,773
These two trees are pretty
close together,

325
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,067
but it looks to me like
this one's more on your side,

326
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:16,986
this one might be more on his.

327
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,988
Yeah.

328
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,949
What are you doing home
in the middle of the day?

329
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,867
I just came back for lunch.

330
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,620
What are you having?

331
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:27,831
Like a Hot Pocket.

332
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:28,873
What line of business
are you in?

333
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,750
I'm a salesman.

334
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,002
(Dwight)
Really? So am I.

335
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,044
Yeah?
What?

336
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:35,505
I sell yarn.

337
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,173
You're a yarn salesman?
Yeah.

338
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:38,675
I have a couple questions
about the neighborhood.

339
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:40,552
Have you had any problems
with prostitution,

340
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:43,930
crack dealing,
gang violence, etcetera?

341
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,808
[groans]
No.

342
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,185
Here's a question for you.
I have a convertible.

343
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:51,771
Is it safe to park that
in my driveway?

344
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,523
All right, see you soon.

345
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,358
A good guy.

346
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,027
Um...

347
00:12:57,068 --> 00:12:58,236
cool.

348
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:04,075
So that's what
this sound is all day.

349
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,410
[laughter]

350
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,078
I think I'm going
to make myself

351
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,122
some microwave popcorn.

352
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,791
[humming]
* La, la, da-da *

353
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,961
Press Popcorn.
Oh, that's gonna be delicious.

354
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,630
I just love having popcorn
in the middle of the afternoon.

355
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:18,840
You know what?

356
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:21,468
I could do with some
hot chocolate as well.

357
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,929
Oh, drat,
I can't make hot chocolate

358
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:27,849
and popcorn at the same time,

359
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,601
unless I can!

360
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:35,482
Boom, second microwave
for "le hot chocolate"!

361
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,317
Hello, hello, hi.
Oh, Carol, hi, how are you?

362
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,651
Hey, Michael.
Good to see you.

363
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:39,736
Uh, Michael, this is Bill.

364
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,196
He's the head
of the Condo Association.

365
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,238
Oh!
Hey, how are you?

366
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,573
Nice to meet you, Bill.

367
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:44,824
Bill. Mr. Bill.

368
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,118
(as Mr. Bill)
Oh, no!

369
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,121
Mr. Bill!
Whoa! Ho-Ho!

370
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,915
SNL?

371
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,501
When they pull him apart?

372
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:57,170
He would always get
rolled over by something.

373
00:13:57,212 --> 00:13:59,172
N-Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.

374
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,757
This is smaller
than your old place.

375
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,093
Yes, well, I'm buying it
and I'm not renting it.

376
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:06,680
So it's still an upgrade.

377
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,474
He doesn't know anything
about property ownership.

378
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,184
He's kind of an idiot.
Um...

379
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,144
(Dwight)
Actually, I do own property.

380
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,229
My grandfather left me

381
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,356
a 60-acre working beet farm.

382
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,358
I run it with my cousin Mose.

383
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,777
We sell beets
to local stores

384
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,696
and restaurants.

385
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:25,615
It's a nice little farm.

386
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,868
Sometimes teenagers
use it for sex.

387
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,245
Are we ready
to sign some papers?

388
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,371
Actually, no.

389
00:14:31,413 --> 00:14:33,039
We have a couple of questions,

390
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,624
uh, about the neighborhood.

391
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,543
I-It's very safe.
It's very clean.

392
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,878
Uh, also, it's very accepting

393
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,839
of all lifestyles.

394
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:45,135
It's a very gay-friendly
neighborhood.

395
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,638
Oh, good.
That's good.

396
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,808
It's good to be
accommodating of...that.

397
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,061
Let's go check out
the master bedroom.

398
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,980
Hey, Phyllis.

399
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,941
Do you have any games
that you play in the office?

400
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,401
What do you mean?

401
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,486
You know, like,
little time killer games,

402
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:07,949
like stapler tennis
or something like that.

403
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,993
No.

404
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:11,870
Okay.

405
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,371
Stanley.

406
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:14,956
I just played Dunderball
with Toby.

407
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:16,750
What about you?
You got any games?

408
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,168
Yeah, I got a game.

409
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:21,588
It's called Work Hard
So My Kids Can Go To College.

410
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,256
Fair enough.

411
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:25,925
This, my friends,

412
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,303
is the master bedroom.

413
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:29,971
Check out
the cathedral ceilings.

414
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,265
Those are, like,
17 feet high.

415
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:34,809
We have cable readiness
right there.

416
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,811
I am going to totally
pimp this place out.

417
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,272
I am going to put
a surround sound system.

418
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,899
I am going to put
a plasma screen

419
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,108
right against this wall.

420
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,693
Ooh, terrible idea.

421
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:44,903
'Cause I'm putting my bed
right over here.

422
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,446
No, no, no, no, no.
This is a shared wall.

423
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,864
Neighbor throws
his wife into the wall,

424
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,824
plasma screen hits the floor,
totally smashed.

425
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,659
Well, then I will get
a warranty.

426
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,578
Warranties don't cover it.
Plus, they're a rip-off.

427
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,871
Well, then I won't
get a warranty.
Christina!

428
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,831
Shh!
So, that's the problem.
It's solved.

429
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,792
What?
I don't hear you practicing.

430
00:15:58,833 --> 00:15:59,959
Can you hear that?

431
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,628
[cello playing]

432
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,838
Oh, man!

433
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,550
These babies are thin!

434
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:12,681
[singing Olympic Anthem]

435
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,561
This scented candle

436
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,854
[imitating echo]
--andle, --andle...

437
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:22,440
Which I found in the men's
bathroom, room, room...

438
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:26,861
Represents the eternal...

439
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:31,157
burning of competition
or something.

440
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,992
It smells like cookies.

441
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,244
Yes, it does.

442
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,996
Yes, it does, my friend.

443
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:38,331
Okay, we will be competing

444
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,709
for gold, silver, and bronze

445
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,751
yogurt lids.

446
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,878
Now, the bronze
are really blue.

447
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,463
And they're also
the backside of the gold,

448
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,631
so no flipping.

449
00:16:46,673 --> 00:16:48,508
Okay?
Honor system.

450
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,639
(Angela)
I do play games.

451
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,932
I sing.

452
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:58,184
And I dangle things
in front of my cats.

453
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,936
I play lots of games.

454
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,771
Just not at work.

455
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,356
Let the games begin.

456
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,150
[applause]

457
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:09,654
[all singing Olympic Anthem]

458
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,700
Second bedroom, whoop!
For the ladies!

459
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:16,119
I mean, the extra ladies
who aren't in my bed

460
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,497
or for friends and family,
whoever wants to pop on by

461
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,292
to casa de Scott,
and right in here,

462
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,044
what's in here?

463
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:28,757
Uh-oh, bedroom number three.
What are we gonna do in there?

464
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,425
Limitless possibilities.
(Dwight)
Seal it off!

465
00:17:30,467 --> 00:17:33,470
What?
What are you doing in there?

466
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:35,430
Fill it full of cotton
or soundproof insulation.

467
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,098
Oh, my God, Dwight!

468
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,933
Seal it off with drywall so you
don't hear Yo-Yo Ma over there.

469
00:17:38,975 --> 00:17:41,061
Oh, you know what I might
do is I might make this

470
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,645
into a kid's room.

471
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,564
Kids, you don't even
have a girlfriend.

472
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,858
I will have a girlfriend
once she sees this place.

473
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,903
I'm gonna get married,
and I'm going to have kids.

474
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,113
(Dwight)
Well, that depends
on how old she is.

475
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,656
What if your girlfriend is 55?

476
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,617
I'm not gonna date
a 55-year-old woman.

477
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,994
Just a possibility.
No, it's not, just shut up!

478
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:01,790
If you fall in love with her.
You're an ass, shut it!

479
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,584
I smell mold.
No, you don't. Stop.

480
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:07,295
Living on a farm, your sense
of smell gets very sharp.

481
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:11,424
For example,
there are beets in a condo

482
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:15,679
two doors down that way, and...

483
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,934
someone over there I believe
is a big fan of olives.

484
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:23,311
And then I just need you
to sign here at this arrow.

485
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:25,105
What kind of mortgage
did you get?

486
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:26,898
Uh, 10-year.

487
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,983
Well, 10 over 30,

488
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,360
so 30-year total.

489
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,278
What? Wha--

490
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,156
You said 10. S--

491
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,991
10-year fixed...

492
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,368
over 30.

493
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,994
30-year total.

494
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,454
Huh. 30 years.

495
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:42,789
Okay, okay, okay.

496
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:45,667
Wow, you'll be payin' this off
in your mid 70s.

497
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:46,918
All right.
[chuckles]

498
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,504
Forget about retiring
when you're 65.

499
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,630
[exhaling]
Hey, I've got an idea.

500
00:18:50,672 --> 00:18:51,965
You know that extra bedroom?

501
00:18:52,007 --> 00:18:53,550
If the whole girlfriend thing
never happens,

502
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,010
that's where the nurse
can live.

503
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,803
Okay, all right.

504
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,014
Oh, boy.
Well, this is it.

505
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,140
Whenever you're ready.

506
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:01,433
Yeah. Um...

507
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,686
that's news to me,
the whole 30 years thing.

508
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:07,522
I think I was pretty clear
about that, Michael.

509
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,357
Moment of reckoning.
It's pretty standard.

510
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,525
All right, it's not
the moment of reckoning.

511
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:11,943
Just stop it.
This is not it.

512
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,987
This is--this--
there's a lot more.

513
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,363
(Dwight)
What is this if this isn't it?

514
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:18,324
Ho. Ho-okay.

515
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,826
Is that supposed to come off?

516
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,411
Actually, yes.
Hey, look, cool.
Carpenter ants.

517
00:19:21,453 --> 00:19:24,330
Um...Gonna take
a little, uh, breather

518
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:25,331
for a second.

519
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,666
Excuse me.

520
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:27,917
It'll be here
waiting for you.

521
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,419
Oh, man.

522
00:19:29,461 --> 00:19:30,545
(Dwight)
A 30-year mortgage

523
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:31,963
at Michael's age

524
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,049
essentially means that he's
buying a coffin.

525
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,675
If I were buying my coffin,

526
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,802
I would get one
with thicker walls

527
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:40,347
so you couldn't hear
the other dead people.

528
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:42,015
[cello playing]

529
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:43,433
[breathing heavily]

530
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,685
Oh!
Whenever you're ready, Michael.

531
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,228
Ugh!

532
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,606
No, this isn't it.

533
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,442
Not by a longshot.

534
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,699
You have what is
the national sport

535
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:01,743
of Icelandic paper companies.

536
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:03,828
And I'm blanking
on the name.

537
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,622
Could you help me out, Pam?

538
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,749
Jim, they refer to it as...

539
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,751
Flonkerton.

540
00:20:09,793 --> 00:20:10,877
(Jim)
Hmm.

541
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:11,920
(Pam)
In English,

542
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,254
Box of Paper Snowshoe Racing.

543
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,756
Fair enough,

544
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:16,758
but I like Flonkerton.

545
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,469
The thing about Jim is,

546
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:20,929
when he's excited
about something,

547
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,639
like the office Olympics,

548
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,182
he gets really into it

549
00:20:24,224 --> 00:20:26,685
and he does
a really great job.

550
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,645
But the problem with Jim

551
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:29,854
is that he works here,

552
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:32,732
so that hardly ever happens.

553
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:35,151
So who will be
challenging Kevin

554
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,444
in Flonkerton?

555
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,238
Anyone?

556
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,239
I'll do it.

557
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,782
Yes! Phyllis!

558
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:43,410
[applause]

559
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:46,413
Phyllis, if you'd just put
your foot right through here.

560
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,997
Right through the flonk.

561
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:50,792
I'm gonna back out of the deal.

562
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:54,254
Nothing personal,
but I feel like I have been

563
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:55,630
taken advantage of here.

564
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,090
How?
[sniffs]

565
00:20:57,132 --> 00:21:00,844
This smells of fraud to me.

566
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,805
This whole thing
just kind of stinks.

567
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,725
The ceilings are lower
than they were last week.

568
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:07,976
That--I don't--

569
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:09,602
What?
I don't know if you showed me

570
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:10,979
this same unit or not.

571
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:12,814
Where--
Michael, this is
the unit you saw, and--

572
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,525
Where are all the hot people?

573
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:16,818
I was told that there would be

574
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,445
all these attractive singles.

575
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,572
Who told you that?
And as far as I can tell,

576
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,948
I'm the best-looking
person here.

577
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,700
(Michael)
There's a basic principle
in real estate

578
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:24,993
that you should never be

579
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:26,828
the best-looking person
in the development.

580
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,496
It's just sorta common sense,

581
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:30,165
because if you are,

582
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:34,002
then you have no place
to go but down.

583
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:35,503
Is this a financial thing?

584
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:36,921
If it's financial thing,

585
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,673
what some people do is, they
rent out the third bedroom.

586
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,091
No, no. No, no, no, no.

587
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,384
And that's some
extra income for you.

588
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:43,136
I am not going to rent
the third bedroom.

589
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:46,931
I want a price reduction
or I am a-walkin'.

590
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:52,187
You will lose $7,000
if you walk away right now.

591
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,731
Muh...

592
00:21:56,566 --> 00:22:00,028
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

593
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:03,448
Cugino's,
what a great bread.

594
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,991
I made the right decision.

595
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,618
I'm glad I signed.

596
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,161
The--I'm a homeowner.

597
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:09,454
Right?

598
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,331
Good to be a homeowner.
Diversifying.

599
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:12,999
This is good.

600
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,876
This is fun.
We're havin' fun.

601
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:16,211
Totally havin' fun.

602
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:17,545
Can you imagine those poor saps

603
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:18,963
stuck at the office today?

604
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,132
[both laughing]

605
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,884
(Jim)
Here we go. Here we go.

606
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,427
[cheering]

607
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,553
Dig deep.

608
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:26,888
Dig deep!

609
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,390
[screaming]

610
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:29,724
Oh!

611
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:30,725
It's Phyllis!
It's Phyllis.

612
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:31,851
(Jim)
Phyllis by a nose.

613
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,436
Gold medal in Flurnenton.

614
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:34,813
Flonkerton!

615
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,065
(Jim)
Thank you,
delegate from Iceland.

616
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,906
(Jim)
Wow. Okay.

617
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,783
No one else should even try.

618
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,076
Gold medals.

619
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,328
[cheering]
Give him medals.

620
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,038
Wow!

621
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,124
[cheers and applause]

622
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,670
Ahh, so want to head back?

623
00:22:58,712 --> 00:23:01,506
Yes.

624
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:05,260
Oh, and...

625
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,012
there's somethin' else, Dwight,

626
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,680
wanted to talk to you about.

627
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:10,515
I have a surprise for you.

628
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:11,725
For helpin' me out today.

629
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:13,601
Oh, you didn't have to do--
No.

630
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:14,769
No.
I insist, I insist.

631
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,229
Because you've really done
some great work.

632
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,355
Great work!

633
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,691
And that is why
I am going to let you

634
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,943
move into my third bedroom

635
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:23,737
and pay me rent.

636
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,780
[gasps]

637
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,365
Why did I do it?

638
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,118
Because I believe in rewarding
people for their efforts.

639
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,621
Uh, I rewarded Dwight

640
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:35,248
with the room,

641
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,959
and he is rewarding me back

642
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:40,712
with, uh, $500
plus utilities.

643
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:41,963
Let's just take a moment though

644
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:43,840
and make sure that this is
the right fit for you.

645
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:45,633
Why are you even saying that?

646
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:48,219
You don't have enough money.

647
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,056
Here's how we'll remedy that.
I can give you a raise.

648
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:53,725
And then we can have Dunder
Mifflin just pay for it.

649
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:58,438
That's not unethical because
Dwight does excellent work,

650
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,483
and he's earned it.

651
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:02,859
Thank you.

652
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:04,986
I guess my philosophy about
Dwight would be this:

653
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:10,617
If you can teach a man, Dwight,
to fish, room,

654
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:14,788
then he will learn,

655
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:19,542
pay $500 in rent,

656
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:24,005
how to fish, plus utilities.

657
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,132
I don't even know
what to say.

658
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:29,427
I'm thinkin', lock into
a four-year commitment.

659
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,471
We'll go month-to-month
after that.

660
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:33,390
Or until I start dating,

661
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:34,849
have a girlfriend.

662
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,142
And then you're, you know,

663
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:37,310
you're gone, so...

664
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:40,271
Question: Where can I put
my terrarium?

665
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,983
What hell is a terrarium?

666
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:46,569
It's a fish tank
for snakes and lizards.

667
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:48,279
Oh, so, an aquarium?

668
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:51,366
Uh, that...

669
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,910
will not come into this place.

670
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,537
Okay?
Question:

671
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:56,579
Oh, my God.

672
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:57,747
My grandparents left me

673
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:00,208
a large number of armoires.

674
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:03,253
Tell you what,
the deal will be off the table

675
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:06,172
in ten minutes,
so take it or leave it.

676
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:10,552
I've got a lot of work to do.

677
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,429
Oh, boy.

678
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:20,687
This whole condo's shifting.

679
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:23,898
It's like this place was built

680
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,735
on an ancient Indian
burial ground.

681
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,069
(Pam)
Are you sure you don't
wanna play?

682
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:29,112
(Angela)
I'm sure.

683
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:30,864
Come on, Angela.
Don't you have a game?

684
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:33,992
I have one, yes.

685
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:35,785
Well, let's play.
What is it?

686
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,245
I call it Pam Pong.

687
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:39,539
I count how many times
Jim gets up from his desk

688
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:41,750
and goes to reception
to talk to you.

689
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:43,418
We're friends.

690
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,253
Apparently.

691
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:46,880
(Jim)
Very nicely done.

692
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:49,758
Okay, so, think that's
H-O-R for Stanley

693
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,134
and H-O for Phyllis.

694
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:52,552
Are you calling me a ho?

695
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:54,262
Oh, my God.

696
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:56,848
Phyllis coming alive.
I like it.

697
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,558
Are you calling me a whore?

698
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,269
Stanley!
That is inappropriate, okay?

699
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:02,854
We just need to stop.

700
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,022
Everybody, let's get involved.

701
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:05,440
There are medals
to be won here.

702
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:06,441
Here we go.

703
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,735
Question:
What about carpooling?

704
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:09,944
Uh, who pays
for the gas?

705
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,112
We take separate cars.

706
00:26:11,154 --> 00:26:12,530
Then question: Can sometimes
I drive your car

707
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:13,490
and you drive mine?

708
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:14,616
(Michael)
Why would we do that?

709
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:16,242
Just for fun?
No.

710
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:17,827
Question: Who's the primary
on the fire insurance?

711
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:21,164
[imitating hockey air horn]
Game over!

712
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:23,500
Offer revoked, Dwight.

713
00:26:23,541 --> 00:26:24,709
I'm sorry,

714
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:27,045
but you reach out
and you try to be a nice guy

715
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:28,213
and help out a friend,

716
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,923
and this is what happens.

717
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:31,549
This is what I get.

718
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:33,802
I--God.

719
00:26:33,843 --> 00:26:35,970
I'm--Okay.

720
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:37,222
Ooh.

721
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,765
(Dwight)
Thank God.

722
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,475
It was nice of him to offer.

723
00:26:40,517 --> 00:26:42,894
But I live in a nine-bedroom
farmhouse.

724
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:45,063
I have my own
crossbow range.

725
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:47,107
It's a perfect situation
for me.

726
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:49,317
Although two bathrooms
would have been nice.

727
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:52,237
We just have the one.

728
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,072
And it's under the porch.

729
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:55,240
[elevator dings]

730
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:56,491
Ah!
Oh!

731
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:58,243
Who had somebody
from Vance Refrigeration?

732
00:26:58,284 --> 00:26:59,911
Ryan Howard.

733
00:26:59,953 --> 00:27:01,913
[cheering]
Ryan.

734
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:03,790
Gold medal.

735
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:06,459
I made something
for our closing ceremonies.

736
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:07,585
What?

737
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:09,004
Oh, my God!

738
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,797
Where'd you have time
to make that?

739
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:12,298
Automatic voice mail.

740
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,551
All right, Pam.
All right.

741
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:15,969
[laughs]

742
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,554
Nice work.

743
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:29,357
You know you can always
refinance your mortgage.

744
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,276
We had a 15-year
on our beet farm.

745
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,402
We paid it off early.

746
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:33,528
Yeah, well,
you know what?

747
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,613
Nobody cares
about your stupid beet farm.

748
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:37,532
Beets are the worst.

749
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,242
People love beets.
Nobody likes beets.

750
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:40,285
Everyone loves beets.

751
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,787
Nobody likes beets, Dwight!

752
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:45,331
Why don't you grow something
that everybody does like?

753
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:48,501
You should grow candy.

754
00:27:48,543 --> 00:27:51,629
I'd love a piece
of candy right now.

755
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:54,049
Not a beet.

756
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,342
Let's get this roof goin'.

757
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:56,801
Stop it!
Ow!

758
00:27:56,843 --> 00:27:58,386
Final lap!
Final lap!

759
00:27:58,428 --> 00:27:59,512
(man)
Oscar!

760
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:00,847
(Jim)
Time to beat is 1:15.

761
00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:03,016
Time to beat is one minute,
15 seconds.

762
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:04,225
Here they come!

763
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:07,395
[cheering and urging]

764
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:12,233
Guys?

765
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:14,152
(Dwight)
What is going on?

766
00:28:14,194 --> 00:28:15,570
Nothing.

767
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:18,198
Guys? Timer still goin'?
Or--

768
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:19,783
That's my stopwatch.

769
00:28:35,924 --> 00:28:39,302
Hey.
That was fun today.

770
00:28:39,344 --> 00:28:42,889
Sorry we didn't get to
the closing ceremonies.

771
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:45,809
Yeah.

772
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,811
Thanks.

773
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:51,898
What...the hell?

774
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:13,670
There you go.
All done.

775
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:15,338
Great.

776
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,966
(Jim)
Yeah, I filled out
the expense reports.

777
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:19,467
That took about five minutes.

778
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:22,470
And then I closed two sales
at lunchtime.

779
00:29:22,512 --> 00:29:26,683
So...about as productive
as any other day.

780
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:29,310
If not more so.

781
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,236
(Ryan)
I figured I could
throw it away now,

782
00:29:38,278 --> 00:29:40,822
or I could keep it
for a couple of months

783
00:29:40,864 --> 00:29:42,657
and then throw it away.

784
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:44,743
I mean, it was really nice
of Pam to make them,

785
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:47,787
but what am I gonna do
with a gold medal

786
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:52,709
made of paper clips
and an old yogurt lid?

787
00:29:57,756 --> 00:30:00,842
Hey, Dwight.
Want to play a game?

788
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:03,011
No.

789
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:05,138
What kind of game?

790
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:08,516
I don't know.
Let's make one up.

791
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,228
Oh, and you can use your weird
rubber band ball if you want.

792
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,356
To do what?

793
00:30:14,397 --> 00:30:16,900
I don't know, um...

794
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:20,570
oh, you know what?

795
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:24,115
Okay, I'll set up
these pencils,

796
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:26,534
and then you try

It'll be like desk bowling
or something like that.

798
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:36,753
I'm really not in the mood
for games today, Jim.

799
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,521
Hey.

800
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:56,022
I have 59 voice mails.

801
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:57,065
Mm.

802
00:30:57,107 --> 00:30:59,567
Hey, can you ignore those

803
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:01,820
and do something
for me instead?

804
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,571
Sure.

805
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:04,698
Okay.

806
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:07,242
Today, 5:00...

807
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:08,785
closing ceremonies.

808
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:10,078
Really?

809
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,788
Notify the athletes.

810
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,248

Yeah?
Jim. Slim Jim.

What's goin'--What's goin' on?

815
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:24,801
Nothin'. I just wanted to
congratulate you on your condo.

816
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:25,927
Oh, thanks.

817
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:27,470
Thanks. It's very cool.

818
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:29,514
It's, uh, three bedroom,
gay-friendly.

819
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:31,224
Nice.
You know.

820
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:33,393
Hey, would you mind
comin' out here for a second?

821
00:31:33,435 --> 00:31:34,310
I just have something for you.

822
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:35,770
Really?

823
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,941
What's this?

824
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,943
There are
the closing ceremonies.

825
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:43,236
Step up.

826
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:45,905
W--Um...

827
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:48,408
You're on the top one.

828
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,285
Congratulations to Michael

829
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:52,287
because he closed on his condo.

830
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:53,872
So gold medal.

what to say.

Um...

834
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:08,303
I'm not one
for making speeches,

835
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:10,764
but, uh...

836
00:32:10,805 --> 00:32:13,475
my heart is very full
at this moment.

837
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:16,978
[applause]

838
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,066
And for Dwight Schrute,
the silver medal.

839
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,109
(Michael)
Get on up here, Dwight.

840
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:29,657
Silver medal.

841
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:31,659
Yep.
Not as good as gold.

Why are you playing
the national anthem?

845
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,172
Um, 'cause your condo's
in America.

846
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:45,715
Oh.

- Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

3
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:22,981
Sure, can I ask who's calling?

4
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:25,984
Just a second.

00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,243
- Katie and Jim
met in the office.

10
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,412
And now I guess
they're, like, going out

11
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,164
or dating or something.

12
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:42,292

I don't know, you know?

They're just--she calls him

I'm sorry, I feel like
I'm talking really loud.

Am I talking really loud?

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,428
- Katie and I have
been out a few times.

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,180
I wouldn't call her
my girlfriend,

19
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,599
but, yeah, I like her a lot.

20
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,017
She makes me laugh,

21
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,353
which I think is
really hard to find.

22
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,189
I mean, Dwight makes me
laugh, too, of course.

23

Okay.

Great. Bye.

give her your extension.

Ryan Howard is sitting

And he has been a temp here
for a couple of months.

35
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:04,249
And he's kind of gotten
the lay of the land

36
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,375
a little bit,

37
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:06,584
had a few laughs along the way,

38
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,422
and now he wants to know
what I think.

39
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,009
- The temp agency
wants to know what you think.

40
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,720
- Shall we?
Let us proceed.

41

First up, proficiency
in necessary skills.

- Oh, that--

I saw the sweat beading.

00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,615

00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:44,581
Mm, mm, not too shabby.

- Okay, uh,

52
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,587
it's excellent, satisfactory,

53
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,173
needs improvement,
or not applicable.

54
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,632
- Or not too shabby.
That's right there--

55
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,343
- Well, there's actually
a separate place for comments.

56
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,470
- I know, I know, I'll--
okay, excellent.

He hasn't evaluated me
in years.

63
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,115
- Attitude. Needs improvement.

64
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,784
- How can I improve that?

65
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,077
- Better already.

66
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,828
To be a boss, a good boss,

67
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,165
you have to have the ability
to recognize talent.

68
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,375
Including your own.

69
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,460
And one of mine,
one of my talents,

70
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,671
is being a mentor.

71
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:36,299
And, not kinda
the stuffy professor guy,

72
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,802

Where do you wanna be?

80
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,816
- Uh, well, I'm interested
in business.

81
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:56,528
- Oh, good, ambitious.
Excellent.

82
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,196
Wanna be a manager?

83
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,073
- Uh, no, actually what I want

84
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,658
is to own my own company.

85
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,911
- That is ridiculous.

93
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,392
No, that was Yoda.

Fozzie Bear.

- 70 and clear, that's nice.

00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,912
Where's that?

102
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,290
- That's here.

103
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,791
- Really?

104
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,754
Wow.

105
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:02,260
- 63, 64, 65.

There are ten rules of business

110
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,489
that you need to learn.

111
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,450
Number one:

112
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,119
you need to play to win...

113
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,621
but...

114
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:35,835
you also have to win to play.

115
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,170
- Got it.

116
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,588
- And I will give you the--

117
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,007
the rest of the ten at lunch.

118
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,387
Very nice.

119
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,101
Hey. [clicks tongue]

120
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,482
- Michael and I have
a very special connection.

121
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:59,192
He's like Batman,
I'm like Robin.

122
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:01,945
He's like The Lone Ranger,
and I'm like Tonto.

123
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,947
And it's not like there was
The Lone Ranger

124
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,032
and Tonto and Bonto.

125
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,915
Hey, how's it going, man?

126
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,375
- Good.

127
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:16,793
What's up?

128
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:20,171
- Oh, nothing much.
What's up with you?

129
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,756
- Uh, I'm good, thanks.

130
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,925
- Good. Good, I'm good, too.

131
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:25,427
Well, how's it crackin'?

132
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,180
- Uh, fine.

133
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,890
What's up?
- You know what you would love?

134
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,100
Guns N' Roses.

135
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,102
When I was your age,
I loved Guns N' Roses.

136
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,228
Do you like Guns N' Roses?

137
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,354
- Uh--
- I'll make you a tape.

138
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,731
- Cool.
- I'll make you two tapes.

139
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,357
- I don't have a tape player.

140
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,442
So--
- [chuckles]

141
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,819
Someday, temp.

142
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:45,530
I've got a couple of shirts
that don't fit so well anymore.

143
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,158
I'll bring 'em by.

144
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,619
Okay!

145
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,338
- Rule three,
reach for the stars.

146
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,797
And if you fail, see rule four.

147
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,300
Rule four,
failure is not an option.

148
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,385
- Got it.
Ryan is gonna love these.

149
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,386
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

150
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,555
And at the end, I will reveal

151
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,557
that they were
all just one rule.

152
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:13,725
- That is so cool.
- Mm-hmm.

153
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,144
- Plus you can go
"Rule five? See rule six.

154
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,771
"Rule six?

155
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,606
See rule five."
- No, I'm not trying

156
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:23,234
to trick him, I'm trying
to be a good mentor.

157
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,736
So--
- Kill or be killed.

158
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,155
- Mm, no.
- Shoot to kill.

159
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,531
Or, kill to shoot.

160
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,741
- No, come on, Dwight.

161
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,159
I have to have
ten of these by lunch.

162
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:33,244
I promised Ryan.

163
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,121
- Just ask for an extension.

164
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,749
- I'm not asking the temp
for an extension.

165
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,751
Unless I really need it.

166
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,420
- Michael and I have
a very special connection,

167
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,131
like an umbilical cord.

168
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,299
And the thing is, with Ryan,

169
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:49,552
is I don't want him
to trip on it or...

170
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,806
get it caught around his neck.

171
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,438
[fire alarm ringing]

172
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,232
People!
- Okay! Everybody?

173
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,442
- This is not a test.
Move to the exits.

174
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,111
- Do not panic!

175
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,779
Get up off your desks!
- No, I don't wanna hear it.

176
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,697
- Do not panic!
- Let's go people!

177
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,698
No, panic is warranted!

178
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:10,699
- Single file line.

179
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,950
- This is not a drill!

180
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,493
- Arms at your side!
Arms at your side!

181
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:14,619
- Please, move quickly.

182
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:16,579
This is a paper company,
people!

183
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,373
Step lively!

184
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,708
This whole place
is a tinderbox.

185
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,001
It is ready to blow.

186
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,797
This is not a test!
Can you leave?

187
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,007
- Oh, you say that
every time.

188
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,134
- Do you wanna die?!
- Oh, boy.

189
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,760
- Do you wanna die?!

190
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:31,845
- Let's go, let's go.
- Out!

191
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:32,846
Stanley,

192
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,222
have you ever seen
a burn victim?

193
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,640
Move to the exits!

194
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:37,392
- You're safety partners!
- Real smoke!

195
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,519
We've got smoke! Smoke!

196
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,691
Gah!

197
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,030
[glass breaking]

198
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,995
Oh, Kelly! Are you okay?
I gotcha!

199
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,705
- Hey, I'm all right!
- Cover your nose and mouth!

200
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,290
Breathe through your nose.
- Get off me!

201
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,291
Breathe through your nose.

202
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,209
Remove your stockings! Okay?

203
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,753
They'll melt
right into your flesh!

204
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,464
Stay below the smoke line.

205
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,631
Let's go!

206
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,592
Clear out, stat!

207
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,719
"Stat" means now!

208
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,933
- Yes, I was
the first one out.

209
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:23,271
A captain is always
the first one on the ship

210
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,566
and the last one off the ship.

211
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:29,652
And...

212
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,529
this parking lot is our ship

213
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:35,283
when the building is on fire.

214
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,660
So...

215
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,371
I ran out onto the ship.

216
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,290
And, yes, I've heard
"women and children first."

217
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:44,834
But we do not employ children.

218
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:47,712
We are not a sweatshop,
thankfully.

219
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,715
And women are equal

220
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:53,176
in the workplace by law.

221
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,637
So, I let them out first,

222
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,056
I have a lawsuit on my hands.

223
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,100
Another rule of business

224
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,644
is being able to adapt
to different situations.

225
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:03,812
- Yeah?

226
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,857
- Adapt, react, readapt...

227
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,860
Apt. Right?
That's rule number two.

228
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,113
- Okay, guys, listen up.
We need a headcount.

229
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:14,698
We need to count off.
Michael's number one.

230
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,699
Where is he? Where is he?

231
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,075
- So what was rule two?

232
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,993
- Uh, adapt, react,
readapt, apt.

233
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,829
- Okay, well,
let's just kinda

234
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,247
take it a little slower.
- Hey, Michael,

235
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,165
uh, Ryan needs a number
for the count off.

236
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,459
- Okay, uh,
well, one is taken.

237
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:27,794
- Uh, okay, two?

238
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:29,504
- No!
- Okay--uh, sorry.

239
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,506
- Okay, he can have 14.
Margery's not here today.

240
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:33,341
- Well, he needs a
permanent number, all right?

241
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:34,175
- No, I don't.

242
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,468
- Oh, you know what else?

243
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,970
I thought of a nickname
for the three of us.

244
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,471
Three musketeers.

245
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,557
- Um, yeah, okay.

246
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,392
That--no, no, no, no!
I got one, I got one.

247
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,476
The three stooges.

248
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,978
- That's funny, too.

249
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,895
But if we're
the three musketeers...

250
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,105
- I don't wanna be, like,

251
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,524
a guy here, you know?

252
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,986
Like, Stanley is
the crossword puzzle guy.

253
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:54,696
And Angela has cats.

254
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:58,533
I don't wanna have
a thing here, you know?

255
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,493
I don't wanna be

256
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,537
the something guy.

257
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:04,289
- Okay, you know what?

258
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,167
I think I'm gonna be
setting the agenda here, okay?

259
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,752
Everybody gather up, please.

260
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,212
Important announcement.
Very important announcement.

261
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:12,797
I think this is
a perfect opportunity

262
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,133
for all of us to participate

263
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,218
in some really intense,

264
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,596
psychologically revealing
conversations.

265
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,890
So we're gonna be playing
Desert Island,

266
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,310
um, "Who Would You Do?"

267
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,895
And, um...
- "Would You Rather?"

268
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,104
- "Would You Rather?"

269
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,564
"Would You Rather?"
is our third game.

270
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,648
[fire truck horn]

271
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,610
[siren blares]

272
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,156
- Yeah!

273
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:44,746
Hey, guys, great response time.

274
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,082
Listen up. I got some theories.

275
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,667
Okay, there's a...

276
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,668
I'm a safety officer.

277
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,419
I'm a volunteer
sheriff's deputy.

278
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:54,339
And I know that when
there's a dangerous situation--

279
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,800
look, I have been training
my whole life for this.

280
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,093
There may be fire

281
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,261
inside the walls right now.

282
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,472
- Yes, there is a real fire.

283
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:03,640
But it's okay.

284
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:05,558
Everyone got out fine.

285
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,478
This is why you
practice these things.

286
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,360
- I like fire drills.

287
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,695
You know what's the greatest?

288
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,071
Like, when you were in school

289
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,656
and the teacher would let you
have class outside.

290
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:20,865
- Oh, the best.

291
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,618
- Yeah, it was great because

292
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,412
it was like
you're supposed to be working,

293
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,038
but nothing ever gets done.

294
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,540
- Yeah, we had outside classes
all the time

295
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,209
and we never did anything.
- [laughs]

296
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,294
- Actually, if I had
had fewer outside classes,

297
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,379
I probably wouldn't be

298
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,589
stuck here at a paper company.

299
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,466
- You're not stuck.

300
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,554
- Okay, so, three books
on a desert island.

301
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,722
Angela.

302
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,265
- The Bible.

303
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:48,852
- That's one book.

304
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,021
You've got two others.

305
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,105
- Uh, "Purpose Driven Life."

306
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,774
- Nice.

307
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,359
Third book.
- No.

308
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:58,820
- Okay, Phyllis.

309
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,280
- Um, "The Da Vinci Code."

310
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,614
- "The Da Vinci Code."

311
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,324
I would take
"The Da Vinci Code"

312
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:04,826
so I could burn
"The Da Vinci Code."

313
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,036
- Okay, great, that's gonna

314
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,204
keep you warm
for, like, seven seconds.

315
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,915
Question, is there firewood
on the island?

316
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,125
- I guess.

317
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,294
- Then I would bring
an axe, no books.

318
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,463
- No, it has to be
a book, Dwight.

319
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,299
- Fine,
"Physician's Desk Reference."

320
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:21,009
- Nice, smart.
- Hollowed out.

321
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:23,011
Inside, waterproof matches,

322
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,347
iodine tablets.

323
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,725
Beet seeds, protein bars,
NASA blanket.

324
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,268
And...

325
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,603
in case I get bored,

326
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,730
"Harry Potter and
the Sorcerer's Stone."

327
00:13:33,772 --> 00:13:35,982
No, "Harry Potter and
the Prisoner of Azkaban."

328
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:39,277
Question, did my shoes
come off in the plane crash?

329
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,987
- Plane crash?

330
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,739
- This is important.

331
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,532
Leather is a food source.

332
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,951
- No, it's not.
- Leather from shoes

333
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,120
can be boiled down
to a simple broth

334
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:51,039
that can sustain a man
for over two weeks.

335
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:52,374
- You just made that up.

336
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,335
- Question, are there
animals on the island?

337
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:57,545
- Rule number four.

338
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,006
"In business,
image is everything."

339
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,008
Andre Agassi.

340
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,052
This car is
an investment, right?

341
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:06,221
If I have to take out a client.

342
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,224
Or I'm seen
around Scranton in it.

343
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,853
I love it. I love this car.

344
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,734
Do you like it?

345
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:20,902
- Yeah.

346
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:23,279
- Okay, I thought people
read more books.

347
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:25,115
DVDs. Five movies.

348
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,282
What would you bring
to the island?

349
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,159
Toby, go ahead.
- Um, "Say Anything,"

350
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,161
"The Shining."

351
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,205
Uh, "Annie Hall."
That's too obvious.

352
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,748
- Those are like
my favorite movies.

353
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,709
I didn't really think
you could win Desert Island,

354
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,293
but I think you just did.

355
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,586
- Oh, "Toy Story 2."

356
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,922
One of the best movies
I ever saw.

357
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,340
I went for my daughter.

358
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,883
And stayed because

359
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:46,302
you can't leave your daughter
in a theater.

360
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:47,470
- Toby and I
used to sit together.

361
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:48,805
Until Michael moved us

362
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,432
because he thought
we talked too much.

363
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,766
- Really?
- Yeah.

364
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:52,767
- Can I go next?

365
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:53,893
- Yes, Meredith.

366
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,020
- "Legends of the Fall,"

367
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,646
"My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"

368
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:57,939
"Legally Blonde,"

369
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,232
"Bridges of Madison County."

370
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,734
- Wow.

371
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,736
"Legends of the Fall."
- Wow.

372
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,863
"Bridges of Madison County,"
"Legally Blonde."

373
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,448
These movies are just--
- Well, I kind of like...

374
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:09,325
- Wait, wait, wait.
Pam, no.

375
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,161
Do you understand?

376
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,496
The game is
desert island movies,

377
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,956
not guilty pleasure movies.

378
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,042
Desert island movies are
the movies you're gonna watch

379
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:18,793
for the rest of your life!

380
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,712
Forever!

381
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,088
Unforgivable.
- I take it back.

382
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,631
- Unforgivable.
- I take it back!

383
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,716
- Good.

384
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:25,967
- And "Ghost."

385
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:28,720
But, uh, just that one scene.

386
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,890
You know that scene?
- Yeah, yes.

387
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,850
- Yeah, I know that scene.
- That was a good scene.

388
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,644
Um, Kevin.

389
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,520
Do it.

390
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,856
- Uh, "Cannonball Run,"

391
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,775
"Cannonball Run 2,"

392
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,485
"Weekend--" [snickers]

393
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,196
"Weekend at Bernie's,"

394
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,531
"Weekend at Bernie's 2,"

395
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,158
and--ooh, "Groundhog Day."

396
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,493
- "Groundhog Day."

397
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:53,161
- I have a client
who watches that movie

398
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,287
once a week at least.

399
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:55,330
- Really?
- I should put you

400
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:56,498
in touch with him.

401
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,499
Maybe we could get together

402
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,750
and work on that account?

403
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,169
- I would love that.
- Okay, guys, guys, guys.

404
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,213
That almost sounded
like business,

405
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,423
and we are trying
to focus here today, okay?

406
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:06,466
- Is this your car, Ryan?

407
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,592
- Wow, some pretty big

408
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:08,927
books back there, huh?
- Don't.

409
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,845
- Good shocks.
- Hello, Mr. Egghead.

410
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:12,847
Beep!

411
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,057
I'm just kidding.

412
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,559
I read a lot. Lot of, uh,

413
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:17,686
lot of suspense thrillers,

414
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,396
lot of business books.
- Yeah.

415
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:21,856
- Funny story, I got this book

416
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,274
"Who Moved My Cheese?"

417
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:25,360
It's a great business book.
- Right.

418
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,945
- But I bought it
because I thought it

419
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,197
was a suspense thriller.

420
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,157
Oh, Stanley Kaplan, I know him.

421
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,910
"M is for Murder," "P is for--"
- That's actually a

422
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:35,286
test prep book.
- "for Phone." What?

423
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,539
- That's a test prep
for business school.

424
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,707
- Oh, thinking
about business school.

425
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,208
- I just got in.
I applied.

426
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,710
I go at night.
- Really?

427
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,795
So, you think you know
a lot about business?

428
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,213
- No, not yet.

429
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:46,881
Just started.
- Uh-huh, yeah.

430
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,550
Quiz me.

431
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,218
- I wouldn't even know--
- Oh, come on.

432
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,261
Come on, Egghead.

433
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,554
Let's do it.
- Do it.

434
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:56,182
- Quiz me up.
- All right, um...

435
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,518
Why have people been rethinking
the Microsoft model

436
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,729
in the past few years?

437
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,526
- When I was Ryan's age,

438
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:08,987
I worked
in a fast food restaurant

439
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,989
to save up money for school.

440
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,033
And then I

441
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,701
lost it in a pyramid scheme.

442
00:17:14,743 --> 00:17:17,912
But I learned more
about business

443
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:19,372
right then and there

444
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,582
than business school
would ever teach me

445
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,417
or Ryan would ever teach me.

446
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:23,585
- When the dollar goes up,

447
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,920
what does that do
to American business?

448
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:28,048
- Pass.
- Up.

449
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,549
- Um, right.
- Pass.

450
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:31,259
- When I was Ryan's age,

451
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:33,386
I worked selling cutlery
for a while.

452
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:36,097
Cutlery that could
decimate a penny,

453
00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:37,432
I kid you not.

454
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:38,516
There were these shears
that could cut

455
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,393
straight through a penny.

456
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:43,355
So, I have life experience

457
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,231
and work experience

458
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,566
that Ryan doesn't

459
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:48,443
and will never have.

460
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:51,196
- Is it cheaper
to sign a new customer

461
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,947
or to keep
an existing customer?

462
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,200
- Keep an existing--
- Shut...it.

463
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,535
Can I just do it please?

464
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,746
Uh, it's equal.

465
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,373
- It is ten times
more expensive

466
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,416
to sign a new customer.
- Okay, yes.

467
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,793
It was a trick question.
- Yeah, but look.

468
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,628
I mean, he didn't need
business school, okay?

469
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:08,213
Michael comes from
the school of hard knocks.

470
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,464
- Okay, Dwight?
- Self-taught.

471
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:10,548
You didn't even go to college.
- You know what?

472
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,550
You don't need
to help me here, okay?

473
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,761
You know, maybe you should
go to business school

474
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:15,637
like Ryan.

475
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,721
Then you'd know what

476
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,473
you're talking about.
- Come on,

477
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,433
I'm studying
with a master, huh?

478
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:21,643
You should learn
from him, right?

479
00:18:21,685 --> 00:18:23,687
Right?
- Stop, Dwight.

480
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:26,398
You know what, Dwight?
You're acting like a dork.

481
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,233
Would you cool it, please?
- [grunts]

482
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,609
Okay.
- Ooh!

483
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:32,445
Hey, he's not your
five-year-old brother, Dwight.

484
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,531
He's a valued member
of this company.

485
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,865
- No, I--
And you know what?

486
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:38,993
He knows more about business
than you ever will.

487
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:42,956
- Stupid.

488
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,624
- I did not go
to business school.

489
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,126
You know who else
didn't go to business school?

490
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,461
LeBron James, Tracy McGrady.

491
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:49,963
Kobe Bryant.

492
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,798
They went right from
high school to the NBA.

493
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,927
So...

494
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:59,639
so it's not
the same thing at all.

495
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,016
Look at this stuff.

496
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,685
Market fragments.
What is that supposed to be?

497
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,520
It's a way of looking
at consumers as subsets

498
00:19:05,562 --> 00:19:09,065
of a larger client base.

499
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:10,525
- Do you have a pen?

500
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,652
- Uh, not on me.

501
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:16,197
Here, um, two shoe salesmen
go into the jungle, okay?

502
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,365
- Yeah.

503
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,616
- On the first day,
they realize

504
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,868
no one in the jungle
wears shoes.

505
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,119
- All right.
- So the first salesman

506
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,287
calls his boss, says,

507
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:25,665
"Nobody wears shoes.
Get me out of here."

508
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:30,211
- I'm a boss.
I, uh, I say, "Okay,

509
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:32,547
but first you have to
reimburse me for your travel--"

510
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:33,715
- No, you're
the second salesman.

511
00:19:33,757 --> 00:19:36,259
You say,
"Nobody down here wears shoes.

512
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:40,680
It's a totally
untapped market."

513
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:41,765
- You are so smart.

514
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,434
You are so F-ing smart.

515
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:46,728
You should be teaching me.

516
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:50,815
Well, I'm smart enough
to know what I don't know.

517
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:54,319
Which is apparently everything.

518
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:56,196
- Pam, get us back into it.

519
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:59,783
Five movies, go ahead.
- Okay, um, "Fargo."

520
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,577
Um, "Edward Scissorhands,"
"Dazed and Confused."

521
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:03,870
- Ooh, definitely
in my top five.

522
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,956
- Yes, in my top three,
so suck it.

523
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,667
"Breakfast Club."

524
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,919
Um, "The Princess Bride."
- Okay, that's five.

525
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,545
[loud snapping]
- No, my all-time favorite!

526
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:14,047
- Pam, play by the rules.
- All-time favorite.

527
00:20:14,089 --> 00:20:16,424
Play by the rules.

528
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,301
Dwight.

529
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:21,513
All-time favorite movie.

530
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,768
- "The Crow."

531
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:29,604
[engine revving]

532
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:33,817
[tires squealing]

533
00:20:39,364 --> 00:20:42,575
- I became a salesman

534
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:43,618
because of people.

535
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,162
I love making friends.

536
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:48,331
But then I was
promoted to manager

537
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:51,710
at a very young age.

538
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,461
And I still try
to be a friend first.

539
00:20:53,503 --> 00:20:57,215
But, you know...

540
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:58,800
When you're very successful,

541
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,553
your co-workers
look at you differently.

542
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:07,350
[sighs]

543
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:10,311
What do you think?

544
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,439
- Maybe we should get some air.

545
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,066
- No, I'm okay.

546
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,737
- I'm really uncomfortable.

547
00:21:19,696 --> 00:21:21,698
- All right, let's move on.

548
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,742
Let's move on
to the main event.

549
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,411
Who would you do?
- Present company excluded?

550
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:27,579
- Um, not necessarily.
- Pam.

551
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,955
- Pam.

552
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:31,875
- Um...

553
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,835
Okay, uh, you know what?
Maybe I'll--

554
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,086
I'll finish explaining
the rules.

555
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:37,130
Let me explain it first
and then...

556
00:21:37,172 --> 00:21:41,301
- * Think you've
had too much *

557
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,510
- Yeah, so we'll get right--

558
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,054
you know what?
I'll be right back.

559
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:46,139
Stanley, you're taking over
for me, buddy.

560
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,266
I'll be right back.
- Okay, um...

561
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,311
["Everybody Hurts"
by R.E.M. continues]

562
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,563
- Dwight.
- * Everybody hurts *

563
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:55,565
[music plays louder]
- Dwight.

564
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,692
Come on, Dwight, use words.

565
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:59,069
- * Sometimes-- *

566
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,030
- Why didn't I go
to business school?

567
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:03,031
- Who goes to business school?

568
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:04,407
- The temp.
- He does?

569
00:22:04,449 --> 00:22:06,785
- Yeah, it's all him and
Michael talk about anymore.

570
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:10,038
- You know, I bet Ryan
thinks to himself,

571
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,166
"I wish I were a volunteer
sheriff on the weekend."

572
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:14,459
- He doesn't even know
that I do that.

573
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,252
- You should tell him.

574
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,254
- Oh, yeah, Pam, right.

575
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:21,007
That's gonna help things,
just talk it out.

576
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,384
I hope the war goes on forever

577
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,635
and Ryan gets drafted.

578
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:24,761
- Dwight.
- What?

579
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:27,222
- I'm sorry I said that.
I didn't--

580
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:29,391
just part of me meant it.

581
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:33,603
Besides, he'd end up
being a hero, anyway.

582
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:35,647
- You know what
you should do?

583
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,149
You should quit.

584
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:41,778
And then, that would
stick it to both of them.

585
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,115
- No, Jim,
I'm not gonna quit.

586
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,408
Then Ryan wins.

587
00:22:46,449 --> 00:22:48,159
- Yeah, you're right.

588
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,704
- Thanks, you guys.

589
00:22:50,745 --> 00:22:52,372
I just need some alone time.

590
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:53,998
- Okay.

591
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:57,752
- All right, buddy.
- * Everybody cries... *

592
00:22:57,794 --> 00:23:00,130
[both laugh]

593
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:01,506
- Hey.

594
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:02,674
Guys, what's going on?
- Hey.

595
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:05,176
- Nothin'.
- What's up?

596
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,720
Can I hang with you guys
for a bit?

597
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:07,929
The warehouse guys are

598
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,389
a bunch of jackasses sometimes.

599
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,099
- Boobs.

600
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:14,060
- What question
are you responding to?

601
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,937
Come on, people, you know
the rules of the game.

602
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:17,022
- Oh, hey, hey, game?

603
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,773
What game are we playing here?

604
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,026
- Okay, it's called
"Who Would You Do?"

605
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,777
- Oh!

606
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,280
I play this at home
all the time

607
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,740
while I'm falling asleep.

608
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:28,116
What, uh--where are we?

609
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:30,118
Where are we here?
- Roy.

610
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,953
- Roy? Roy?

611
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:34,706
Who would you do, Roy?
- Uh...

612
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:35,957
Oh, I got it!

613
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,917
What's the name of that, uh,

614
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:39,544
tight-ass Christian chick?

615
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:40,587
The blonde?

616
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,255
- My name is Angela.

617
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:43,798
- Hey, Angela. Roy.

618
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,924
Nice to meet you.

619
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:46,676
- All right, who's next?
Who's next?

620
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,470
Who's next? Who's--Jim?

621
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,472
You're next.
Who would you do?

622
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:52,807
- Um...

623
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:56,144
Kevin, hands down. Yeah.
[group laughing]

624
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,980
He's really got that teddy bear
thing going on and...

625
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:01,191
Afterwards, we could
just watch bowling.

626
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:02,817
- [chuckles]

627
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,819
- Well, I would definitely

628
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:08,865
have sex with Ryan.

629
00:24:08,907 --> 00:24:11,576
'Cause he is gonna
own his own business.

630
00:24:11,618 --> 00:24:13,912
- You're all gay.
[cackles]

631
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,830
- Who's, uh, who's next?
Who we got?

632
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,207
[phone ringing]

633
00:24:17,248 --> 00:24:18,750
Who?
- Hey.

634
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,168
No, I can talk, I can talk.
I can talk.

635
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,003
- Well, wish I had
my cell phone,

636
00:24:22,045 --> 00:24:23,505
but I left it inside, so...

637
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:24,839
- Would that make you happy?

638
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:25,840
- What's that?
- If you had your cell phone?

639
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:27,092
Would it make you happy?
- Yeah.

640
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,010
- I'm on it.
- Dwight, hey!

641
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,887
- You can't go back in yet!
- Dwight, don't!

642
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:32,222
- He is an idiot.

643
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,474
The man is an idiot,
ladies and gentlemen.

644
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,851
- What if he dies in the fire,

645
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:39,354
and that's the last thing
you ever said to him?

646
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:42,315
I didn't say it to him,
I said it about him.

647
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,820
- And then you go to school

648
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:47,779
for three years?
- For two years,

649
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:48,863
and it's only at night,

650
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:49,781
and then it's on
your résumé forever.

651
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:50,865
- Wow.

652
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:51,866
And just out of curiosity,

653
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:53,159
how much is it?
- 650 bucks.

654
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:54,911
- A semester?
- A credit.

655
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:56,621
- Wow.
- It's an investment.

656
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:59,624
- No, yeah, sounds like it.

657
00:24:59,666 --> 00:25:01,042
- I think it's worth it.

658
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:06,131
- Jim.
- Definitely Jim.

659
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,133
- Definitely, definitely Jim.

660
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:09,718
- Come on, Pam.
- What about you, Pam?

661
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,636
- Um...

662
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:12,804
Oscar's kind of cute.

663
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,681
- Yeah, I like Oscar.

664
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:16,766
- Ooh, Toby.

665
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:18,727
- How long does it take

666
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:23,273
to find a cell phone?

667
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,859
I don't know either.
- Um, is there anybody else?

668
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:28,445
- [clears throat]

669
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:32,741
- Hey, where are you?
Oh, good.

670
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:34,576
Yeah, we're just here.
We're playing Desert Island.

671
00:25:34,617 --> 00:25:36,911
It's where you pick
your five favorite DVDs.

672
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:41,916
- Seriously,
where the hell is Dwight?

673
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:45,253
[clears throat] Hey.
- I don't know.

674
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:46,921
Call my cell phone.

675
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:50,925
It'll make it easier
for him to find.

676
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,177
- What's your number?

677
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:55,096
- I gave it to you in the car.

678
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:58,558
- Um...
- I saw you program it in.

679
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,060
- You gotta--you gotta
give it to me again.

680
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,395
- Okay, all right.

681
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:08,234
- Now, I have it.

682
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:15,325
[cell phone playing "Mambo #5"]

683
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:19,788
- Uh...

684
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:21,581
I better tell somebody.

685
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:24,084
Excuse me, sir?
- [coughing]

686
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,586
- Dwight! Dwight!

687
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:29,631
God, man, why did you
go in there?

688
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:31,675
Everybody was scared
out of their wits, man.

689
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:32,967
- Everyone, okay.

690
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,470
Uh... I have an announcement.

691
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:38,473
Apparently, in business school,

692
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,266
they don't teach you
how to operate

693
00:26:40,308 --> 00:26:42,227
a toaster oven.

694
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,646
Because some smart, sexy temp

695
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:46,690
left his cheese pita

696
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:48,149
on oven instead of timing it

697
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:49,693
for the toaster thing!

698
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:51,152
[laughing]

699
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:54,489
- Oh, wow! Okay.

700
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:56,533
Well, I guess they don't teach

701
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:59,244
how to operate a toaster oven
in business school--

702
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,495
- That's exactly what I said!

703
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,622
- Hey, did you miss that day,
there, Ryan?

704
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:05,166
- Were you absent?
- "Toaster Oven 101"?

705
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:06,167
- You failed?
- I am so sorry.

706
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:09,504
- Oh, man.

707
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:11,840
Hey, I know what'll
impress everybody.

708
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:13,842
I'll start a fire.

709
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,260
Oh, man.

710
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:18,221
Bad idea. Bad idea jeans.

711
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:20,140
- I have a song--
attention everyone--

712
00:27:20,181 --> 00:27:21,349
that I wanna sing.

713
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:23,268
That I wrote especially
for this occasion

714
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,812
when I was up there
among the flames.

715
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:26,938
Ready?

716
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,607
* Ryan started the fire *

717
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:32,902
* It was always burning since
the world's been turning *

718
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:35,530
both: * Ryan started the fire *

719
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,157
* It was always
burning since--*

720
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:38,616
- Everybody!

721
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:44,039
- I can't believe
I started the fire.

722
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,208
both: [mumbling lyrics]

723
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,085
- * Marilyn Monroe *

724
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:52,047
both: * Ryan started the fire *

725
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,506
* It was always burning... *

726
00:27:53,548 --> 00:27:55,008
- Eat it!

727
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,217
Eat it! He has to eat it!
- Hi!

728
00:27:56,259 --> 00:27:57,385
- Hey.
- How are you?

729
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:58,720
- Good, how are you?
- I'm good.

730
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:00,096
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

731
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:01,848
- I'm hungry.
- Yeah, I am too.

732
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,266
- Oh, I have been thinking

733
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:05,268
the whole way over,

734
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:07,228
and I have my answers.
- What answers?

735
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,563
- Uh, for the desert island.

736
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:09,773
- Oh, right!
Right, right, right!

737
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:10,857
Come on, come on.

738
00:28:10,899 --> 00:28:12,233
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather 'round.

739
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,318
We have one more participant.

740
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,569
Come on, be polite.

741
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:15,487
Be polite.

742
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:18,198
Desert island, five movies, go.

743
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:22,035
- Okay, um, first,

744
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:23,036
"Legally Blonde."

745
00:28:23,078 --> 00:28:25,330
- [laughs]

746
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:29,417
I forgot what
a super nice girl Katie is.

747
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,127
And, just--good for Jim.

748
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:33,254
They are so cute together.

749
00:28:33,296 --> 00:28:37,217
And, um, what an adorable car!

750
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:38,927
- Okay!

751
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,220
I think the game's over.

752
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,262
People are, like, leaving.

753
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,847
There was
a bigger crowd last time.

754
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:44,432
Do you wanna just go to lunch?
- Okay.

755
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:45,809
- Yeah?
- All right, you wanna drive?

756
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,269
- Sure.
- All right.

757
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:57,946
They are so cute.

758
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,280
- I'm really sorry, Dwight.

759
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:00,782
- Answer me this, though.
- What?

760
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:02,283
- Was it worth it?

761
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:03,535
Was it worth it, temp?
- No.

762
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:04,828
- Was it worth it?
- Really?

763
00:29:04,869 --> 00:29:05,870
- I'm really sorry, Dwight.

764
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,288
- The fire guy.
[laughs]

765
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,456
The fire guy!

766
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:09,582
* Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon *

767
00:29:09,624 --> 00:29:11,001
* Studebaker television *

768
00:29:11,042 --> 00:29:12,127
* North Korea, South Korea *

769
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:13,461
* Marilyn Monroe *

770
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:15,588
* Ryan started the fire *

771
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,341
- Okay, rule five,
safety first,

772
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:22,262
i.e., don't burn
the building down, okay?

773
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:23,179
That should be a no-brainer.

774
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:25,098
Oh, look...

775
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,435
Ryan is book smart.

776
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:30,979
And I am street smart.

777
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,564
And book smart.

778
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:36,901
I'll give you the rest
of the ten tomorrow.

779
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:42,323
- I'm Michael's number two.
He's one, I'm two.

780
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:43,533
He's alpha, I'm beta.

781
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:45,118
He's A, I'm B.

782
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,327
It's easy.

783
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:48,413
Whatever Michael is,
I'm one less.

784
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,498
I am Michael's right-hand man.

785
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,709
And he doesn't need
another right-hand man

786
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:55,045
because he's only got
one right arm.

787
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:57,589
I know Michael's every move.

788
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,841
It's not something
you can just pick up.

789
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:01,509
I could write a book about him.

790
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:03,345
Literally.

791
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:05,180
I started one once,

792
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:07,515
but Michael made me stop.

793
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:11,061
- If I could change
the life of one person,

794
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:12,604
just one person,

795
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:15,523
I--actually,
that's shooting kinda low.

796
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,025
I already did that.

797
00:30:17,067 --> 00:30:18,068
When I was born.

798
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:20,195
Changed two people's lives.

799
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:21,488
Mom and Dad.

800
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,156
Um...

801
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:27,369
if I could change
the lives of 5,000 people,

802
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,870
10,000,

803
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:29,829
nah, five.

804
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,956
I'd be satisfied with 5,000.

805
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:35,293
I--10,000 though,

806
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,253
that'd be something.

807
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:41,091
Wow, 10,000 people.

808
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:45,762
Because you know what?
Even one is amazing.

1
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,974
[door closes]

2
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,560
Where is my desk?

3
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:20,979
That is weird.

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,149
This is not funny.
This is totally unprofessional.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,026
Okay. Well, you're the one
who lost the desk.

6
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:27,152
I didn't lose
my desk.

7
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:28,570
Okay, calm down.

8
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:30,030
Where was the last place
you saw it?

9
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:31,740
Okay, who moved
my desk?

10
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,825
I think you should retrace
your steps.

11
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,660
Okay, I am going

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,120
to tell Michael,

13
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,831
and this entire office
will be punished.

14
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,541
Colder.

15
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,796
Warmer.

16
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:49,174
Little warmer.

17
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:50,884
There you go.
Ooh, warmer.

18
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,844
Warmer.

19
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,179
Warmer.

20
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,388
Warmer. Warmer.

21
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,556
Cold. Cold. Cold.

22
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,724
Back up.

23
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:02,020
Ooh. Ooh. Warmer.

24
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,856
Hot. Red hot. Hot.

25
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,150
Very hot.

26
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,653
[phone ringing]

27
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,246
Dwight Schrute.

28
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,706
Hi, Dwight.

29
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,750
Um, what sort of discounts
are we giving

30
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,293
on the 20 pound white?

31
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:27,128
Jim, I've given you this
information, like, 20 times.

32
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,672
I know.

33
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,674
[toilet flushes]

34
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,677
It's by the ream?

35
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,886
Uh, yeah.

36
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,097
It is now 9.78.

37
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,723
So it's a discount of 7%.

38
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,434
Okay, thank you.
Gotta get back to work.

39
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,899
Wash your hands, Kevin.

40
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,902
[upbeat music]

41
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:58,868
* *

42
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,519
Right.

43
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,229
Oh, well, let me just
check the pricing list.

44
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,064
Hold on one second.
Sensei.

45
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,817
Hello, it's sempai.

46
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,444
Dwight.

47
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,070
You know what, let me
give you a call right back.

48
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,239
I'm going to find it
and then I'll call you back.

49
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,407
Thanks.

50
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,993
Yes, I just had a ques--

51
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:41,453
Yes, sensei.

52
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,371
Arigato gozaimashita.

53
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,664
Hai.

54
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,002
Was that your mom?

55
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,629
No. That was my sensei.

56
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,214
Oh, thought it was
your mom.

57
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,717
I am now sempai,

58
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,802
which is assistant sensei.

59
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,471
Assistant to the sensei,
that's pretty cool.

60
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,098
Assistant sensei.
Okay.

61
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,976
I am a practitioner
of Goju-Ryu Karate

62
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,853
here in Scranton.

63
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,355
(all)
Huh!

64
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,647
2.
(all)
Huh!

65
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,441
Dwight,
stamp and kick back. 3.

66
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:12,442
(all)
Huh!

67
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,611
My sensei, Ira,

68
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,780
recently promoted me
to purple belt

69
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,824
and gave me the duties
of a sempai.

70
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,618
Not that a lot of people
here in America

71
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,703
know what a sempai is.

72
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,956
But it's equally as respected
as a sensei.

73
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,333
Huh!
Great.

74
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,584
Huh!
Excellent.

75
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,878
Huh!
That's okay.

76
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,505
Huh!
Good.

77
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,631
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.

78
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:36,508
[pager beeping]

79
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,009
Sorry, just one sec--
Dwight--

80
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,969
Dwight, you can't use your
pager in here, I told you.

81
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,513
Okay, it's just--
it's a sales call.

82
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,890
Dwight, ten push-ups.

83
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,266
Ten push-ups!

84
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:46,559
I can--
Yes, sensei!

85
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:48,728
Go!

86
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,606
One, two.
And snap, okay?

87
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,776
Now, Dwight got hurt
last week, all right?

88
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,903
It's because we didn't
pull our kicks back.

89
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,615
When we fight in-class,
we don't fight full-contact.

90
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,660
From now on, not full-contact
with Dwight, okay?

91
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,370
(Dwight)
Do I feel bad that I haven't

92
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:07,247
bonded with the other students?

93
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,082
No, I'm not there
to make friends.

94
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:10,917
I'm there to attack people.

95
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:18,299
I don't want to stay
until 7:00 again this year.

96
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,469
I don't really have
any control over that, Stanley.

97
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,436
Michael tends
to procrastinate a bit

98
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,062
whenever he has to do work.

99
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,897
Um, time cards.

100
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,150
He has to sign these
every Friday.

101
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,110
Purchase orders
have to be approved

102
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,737
at the end of every month.

103
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,572
And expense reports.

104
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,449
All he has to do
is initial these

105
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,075
at the end of every quarter.

106
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,661
But once a year, it all falls
on the same Friday.

107
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,580
And that's today.

108
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,915
I call it
the perfect storm.

109
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,209
* I don't want to work *
[clinking mug with finger]

110
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,754
* I just want to bang
on this mug all day * *

111
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,505
Did you ask me here
for any specific reason?

112
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,591
Ah, yes. I did.

113
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,760
Here's the dizzle.

114
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,347
I have a very top secret
mission for you.

115
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,224
I want you to update all the
emergency contact information.

116
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,976
Why is that secret?

117
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,019
[knock at door]

118
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,312
(Michael)
Hello. Oh, God.

119
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,521
Busy work. Get away.
Get away.

120
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,939
Ah, cretin.

121
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,775
Um, I put stickers
so you know where to sign.

122
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,068
Yes, thanks.
I know where to sign.

123
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,694
It's just that last year,
you--

124
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,196
Last year,
they were out of order,

125
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,781
weren't they, Pam?

126
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,283
Well, the last pickup
for overnight deliveries

127
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,370
is at 7:00, so you need
to have them signed by then

128
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,913
or much earlier.

129
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,458
Chillax, Pam.
Stop Pam-MSing.

130
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,751
That's pretty good.

131
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:35,919
Um, actually,
I'm sending Ryan

132
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,796
on a top secret mission.

133
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,631
Tell her what it is.

134
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,925
Updating emergency contacts.

135
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,928
Well, is that really
a priority?

136
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,304
(Michael)
Is it a priority?

137
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,514
Oh, I don't know.

138
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,933
Um, what if there's
a tornado, Pam?

139
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,976
People's legs are crushed
under rubble.

140
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,188
Please, would you be so kind
as to call my wife?

141
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,773
No. I can't.

142
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:58,650
Because we don't have any
emergency contact information

143
00:05:58,692 --> 00:06:00,902
because Pam said
it wasn't a priority.

144
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:02,362
Think.
Think with your head, Pam.

145
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,155
Okay, well, she walks out.

146
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,157
That's the problem
with being a boss

147
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,993
is that when you are tough,
they resent you

148
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,621
and when you are cool,
they walk all over you.

149
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,540
Catch-22.

150
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,544
Catch-22. Yes.

151
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,630
Why don't you give me

152
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,132
your contact information
to start with, okay?

153
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,342
What's your cell?

154
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,177
Uh, Larisa Halpert.

155
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,303
What's her address?

00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,348
[cell phone rings]
117 Von Bergen Street.

157
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,766
Hello.

158
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,977
[Michael in high voice]
Hey, Ryan.

159
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:37,647
[snickers]
This is Michael Jackson

00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,858
calling from Wonderland.

161
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,528
You mean Neverland?

00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,530
This is Tito.

00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,243
What?

165
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,538
Calling from--

168
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,502
That sucks.

169
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,088
You're making this up
as you go along, aren't you?

170
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,548
I am just following
the website.

171
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,716
Well...

172
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,509
at least I don't
have cavities.

173
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,887
Yes, you have
very nice teeth.

174
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,597
Thanks.

emergency contact?

Pick up.

180
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,195
Hello?

181
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,155
[Michael in high voice]
This is Mike Tyson.

00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,907

184
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,080
Thank God it's Friday.

185
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,165
Mm.

186
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,004
Are you going
to happy hour later?

187
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,049
Ugh, I'm still recovering
from last night.

188
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,342
Ah.

189
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:49,260
But maybe.

190
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,139
Hey, Dwight.

191
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,851
As sempai, do you ever think
there's gonna be a day

192
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,647
where humans and robots
can peacefully coexist?

193
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,107
Impossible.

194
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,192
The way they're programmed...

195
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,946
You're mocking me.
No, I'm not.

196
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,740
Well, let me offer you
a little piece of advice.

197
00:08:10,782 --> 00:08:14,452
I am not afraid
to make an example out of you.

198
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,912
Well, that's not advice.

199
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,747
What advice sounds like
is this.

200
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:21,710
Um, don't ever bring
your purple belt to work

201
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,087
because someone might
steal it.

202
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,463
Okay, give that back
to me.

203
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,464
Okay, say please.

204
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,757
No. That is not a toy.

205
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,175
Please.
Please.

206
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,636
Good. And it absolutely
is a toy.

207
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,263
Arigato.
Arigato.

208
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,389
This is not a toy.

209
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:36,099
This is a message

210
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,768
for the entire office
so that everyone

211
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,811
could see
that I am capable

212
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,187
of physically
dominating them.

213
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,315
[grunting]

214
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,527
And this is more
of a yin-yang thing.

215
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,864
The Michael is all cursive,
Scott all caps.

216
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,657
Left brain, right brain.

217
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,576
Or a duality of man.

218
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,994
[knock on glass]

219
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,371
Could you practice
on the forms?

220
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,167
[groans softly]

221
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:05,003
What about Oscar?

222
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,172
Could you beat Oscar?
No problem.

223
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,840
(Jim)
Oh, no,
he looks pretty scrappy.

224
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,258
(Dwight)
Unless he has a shiv,

225
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,926
in which case
it wouldn't be a fair fight.

226
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,346
True.
Meredith?

227
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,514
No women or children
unless provoked.

228
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,974
Okay. Roy.

229
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,934
Warehouse guy.
Doesn't count.

230
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,936
Okay. Michael.
Could you beat up Michael?

231
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,356
Yeah, I don't think
that would happen.

232
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,982
'Cause we're friends.

233
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,234
Because I would
kick his ass.

234
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,236
Well, Dwight's
purple belt, so...

235
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,989
So? I've beat up
black belts. Yeah.

236
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,824
How'd you know
they were black belts?

237
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,452
They told me after.

238
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,829
See, I used to run
with a very tough crowd,

239
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,539
street fighter types.

240
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,459
Real, real bad people.

241
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,544
I'm just lucky I got out.

242
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,380
I was a badass mofo.

243
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,465
Stanley knows
what I'm talking about.

244
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:51,758
Excuse me?

245
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,551
Never lost a fight.
You know why?

246
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,304
My motto.
Never say die.

247
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,682
You just said it.
You just said it.

248
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,808
No, that's not how
I meant it.

249
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,059
He just--
No.

250
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,396
You said it.
Shut up, Dwight.

251
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,064
[breathes deeply]

252
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,440
Do you think
he signed them yet?

253
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,817
Signed what?

254
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,820
Forget it.

255
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,488
Is that
chocolate vanilla swirl?

256
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,073
Just chocolate.

257
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,367
Angela, for the last time,

258
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:19,327
I did not eat your
chocolate vanilla swirl.

259
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,373
Don't look at me.

260
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,586
I don't know why
I write my name on things.

261
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,088
[sighs]

262
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,340
Is your wife
still your contact?

263
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,384
Uh, ex-wife, yeah.

264
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,804
Uh, her last name
is Becker now.

265
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:40,265
Okay.

266
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:42,684
You don't need
to write "ex".

267
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:44,185
(Michael)
And after that,

268
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,272
nobody ever messed with
the damn rascals ever again.

269
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,898
Sounds tough.

270
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,442
When you're a Jet,

271
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:52,444
you're a Jet all the way,
right?
You're a Jet?

272
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,987
Have you signed
the expense reports yet?

273
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:56,031
Yes, in theory I have.

274
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,117
I just need to cross
some Ts and dot some Is.

275
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:01,786
All right.

276
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,747
I am going to be
in my office,

277
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,832
if anybody needs me.

278
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:06,958
Hoo! Ha!

279
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,127
Oh, wow.
Michael.

280
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,254
Sleeper hold.
Bed time for vato.

281
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:12,630
Oh.

282
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,007
(Dwight)
Stop it.

283
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,133
(Michael)
Oh ho ho ho.

284
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,468
You are the weakest link.

285
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,677
Ow!

286
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,138
I'm friends with everybody
in this office.

287
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,099
We're all best friends.
I love everybody here.

288
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,394
But sometimes
your best friends

289
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,480
start coming in
to work late

290
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,273
and start having dentist
appointments

291
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,025
that aren't dentist
appointments.

292
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,027
And that is when it's nice
to let them know

293
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:36,154
that you could
beat them up.

294
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,530
Just hit me.
You'll see.

295
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,615
I can't.

296
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,867
'Cause I just got a manicure,
so...

297
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,411
Oh, queer!
Eye. Queer Eye.

298
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,497
That's a good show.
Important show.

299
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,873
Go ahead. Do it.

300
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:48,375
Just have Dwight punch you.

301
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,502
Oh, yeah. Well, that would
be kind of worthless

302
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,671
because I know
a ton of 14-year-old girls

303
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,005
who could kick his ass.

304
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,715
You know a ton
of 14-year-old girls?

305
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,093
Look. Dwight is a wuss.

306
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,053
When we rented Armageddon,

307
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:01,763
he cried at the end of it.

308
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,348
No, Michael,
I told you.

309
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,974
That was because
it was New Year's Eve

310
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,685
and it started to snow
at exactly midnight.

311
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,019
[mock crying]
Bruce Willis.

312
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,604
They're going to leave him
on the asteroid.

313
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:10,772
Okay, I'll punch you.

314
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:11,981
Oh, okay.
Here we go.

315
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:13,358
All right. Come on.

316
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,526
Gah!

317
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,528
[coughs, gags]

318
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,239
[inhaling deeply]
Oh!

319
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,907
Did I want to harm Michael,

320
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,951
the one man
I've been hired to protect?

321
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,619
No, I did not.

322
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,620
Are you okay?

323
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:26,705
[hoarse] Yes.

324
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,706
Are you sure
you're all right?

325
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,541
Yeah. Yeah.

326
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,918
Thank you.

327
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,133
I come from a long line
of fighters.

328
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,426
My maternal grandfather

329
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,052
was the toughest guy
I ever knew.

330
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,679
World War II veteran.

331
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,557
Killed 20 men
then spent the rest of the war

332
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,600
in an allied prison camp.

333
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:50,145
My father battled

334
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,732
blood pressure and obesity
all his life.

335
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,608
Different kind of fight.

336
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,193
Still noble.

337
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:58,528
If I come for you--

338
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,696
'cause your cartilage
can go right through.

339
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,323
Okay, take this pen
and stab me with it.

340
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,326
Okay, he has
to be stopped.

341
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:08,163
Please, please, please,
please, just ask Michael.

342
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:10,457
[indistinct chatter]

343
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,833
I don't know.

344
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,626
Ha.

345
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,047
Okay. I'll buy you
a bag of chips.

346
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,548
French onion?

347
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,091
Obviously.
Why are you spinning
around?

348
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,594
Okay.
Yes.

349
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,971
Take this pen, okay?

350
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,973
Stab me with it.

351
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,099
(Michael)
Go away.

352
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,351
I just have
a quick question.

353
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,936
I haven't signed them,
okay?

354
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:33,605
No, it's not that.

355
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,398
Um, I was just wondering,

356
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,359
since I'm probably going
to have to stay late,

357
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,444
could you ask Dwight
to stay late too

358
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,072
so he can walk me
to my car?

359
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:45,700
Come in.

360
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,703
Uh, Pam,

361
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,038
I hate to break this
to you,

362
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,290
but Dwight can't stop you
from being mugged.

363
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,125
He's just not
tough enough.

364
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,127
He's a purple belt.
That's really high.

365
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,962
Oh, I could beat up Dwight.
That's ridiculous.

366
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,589
I can murder him.

367
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,466
It's just that out there,
you...

368
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,842
Oh, is that what
they're saying?

369
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,011
Yeah, kind of.
Okay. All right.

370
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,472
Where's Dwight?
Uh, kitchen.

371
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,391
Okay.

372
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,688
(Dwight)
Try it again. Here we go.

373
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,106
Hi-yah!
Good.

374
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:17,440
Wow, it was actually
pretty close, right?

375
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,275
Excellent. Now watch.
Let me take you from behind.

376
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,318
What?
(Michael)
Watch out, Kelly.

377
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,320
He might sucker punch you.

378
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,738
I didn't sucker punch you,
Michael.

379
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,615
No, really?

380
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,158
In case you didn't remember,
I was defending my honor.

381
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,660
Like a samurai.
Really?

382
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,161
Yeah.
Well, the offer,
Dwight,

383
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,747
was for one punch,
which I absorbed.

384
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,458
I had no idea that there'd be
a second punch.

385
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,335
So catch-22.

386
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,171
(Dwight)
Okay, fine. Tit for tit.

387
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:43,341
Give it your best shot.
Two punches. Go.

388
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,176
Look. If we were in a bar
right now,

389
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,428
there would be two punches.

390
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,430
Me punching you
and you hitting the floor.

391
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,681
No, I'd block
your first punch

392
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,057
rendering you ineffective.
Oh, really?

393
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,392
Yeah.
You know what,

394
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:54,185
you're just lucky
that we're at work right now.

395
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,353
Ooh, what about
Dwight's dojo?

396
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,397
No, they just have classes.

397
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,107
It's free during the day.
It's fine.

398
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,358
I've got the key.
Hey, Michael.

399
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,693
Hey, Toby.
Any word
on those time cards?

400
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:02,986
Hey, you know what?
I have an idea.

401
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:04,612
Why don't you leave
right now?

402
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:08,199
Why don't you walk
away from the room, okay?

403
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,868
Fine.

404
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,828
We'll go at lunch.

405
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,331
Pam, make an announcement.

406
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,208
Figure out carpools.

407
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,056
He's leaving the office?

408
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,933
I know...
You gotta be kidding me.

409
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:35,727
(Jim)
Um, well, we're all
getting excited

410
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,812
to see this fight.

411
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,231
The Albany Branch is working
right through lunch

412
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,566
to prevent downsizing.

413
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:44,569
But Michael, he decided
to extend our lunch

414
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,988
by an hour so that we could
all go down to the dojo

415
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,240
and watch him fight Dwight.

416
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:53,119
Fight. Fight. Fight.
Fight. Fight. Fight.

417
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:55,413
Fight. I'm coming. Fight.

418
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,752
Sorry.

419
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,712
[elevator dings]

420
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,888
I recognize that.

421
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,182
That is Japanese
for California roll.

422
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,600
Uh, no, it's not.

423
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:17,060
I think it is.
A guy told me about that.

424
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:18,812
Actually, it's a symbol
for eternal discipline.

425
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:19,938
Oh.

426
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,481
Your shoes.
Yes?

427
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:22,524
You're gonna have
to take 'em off.

428
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,234
It's a sign of respect.

429
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,652
Oh.

430
00:16:25,694 --> 00:16:29,531
Well, in my office
if you took off your shoes,

431
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:31,950
it would be a sign
of disrespect.

432
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,036
Stinky feet feel.
Kind of a yin-yang.

433
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,830
Hoo-ch-ch-ch-cha!

434
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:38,331
Ch-ch-ch-ch-cha!

435
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,582
Oh, stretching.

436
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:41,835
I like to stay tight.
Compact.

437
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,337
Gaaah!

438
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,922
[exhaling rapidly]
Here's your gear.

439
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:46,923
Please put this on.

440
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:48,633
Do you have, uh,

441
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,760
do you have anything
in, like, black?

442
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:51,928
No, just white.
All right.

443
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,346
Wow. That is really
interesting.

444
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,681
What?

445
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:55,724
Your love l--
I'm just kidding.

446
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:57,183
I can't see anything.

447
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,394
Look closer.

448
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:01,354
Okay.
One point for me.

449
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,814
Tied up.
Oh, you're dead.

450
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:03,940
What? What are you
going to do?

451
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,191
Bring it, Beesly.
Bring it.

452
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,735
Ooh, yeah. Good move.

453
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,820
Ooh, not such
an ultimate fighter now, huh?

454
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,447
Oh, put me down.

455
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,906
[laughing]
Put me down.

456
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,408
Oh my God.
Hey, put me down.

457
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,702
Hey.

458
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,851
You ready?

459
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:41,978
Okay, gentlemen, listen up.

460
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,772
After a clean strike
to the chest,

461
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:45,899
stomach, or kidneys,

462
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,068
I will separate you
and award a point.

463
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,611
First person
to three wins, all right?

464
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:50,987
Yes, sensei.
Lot of rules.

465
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,822
Lot of rules. On the street,
we didn't have any rules.

466
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,991
Maybe one. No kicks
to the groin.

467
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,409
Home for dinner.

468
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,079
Hi, sensei!
Hi, Dwight!

469
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,705
That's Alyssa, my sempai.

470
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,123
She just qualified
for regionals.

471
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:03,792
Osu!

472
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,127
Alyssa?

473
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:08,630
I guess she's technically
the sempai.

474
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,840
But nobody really respects her.

475
00:18:10,882 --> 00:18:12,550
The only reason she got into
regionals

476
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,470
was because her competition was
a bunch of 13-year-old girls.

477
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,721
[scoffs]

478
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,348
Put me in that division.

479
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,725
Let's see how she does.

480
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,394
Hajime!
Ha-yah!

481
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,521
Whoa, hey!
What the hell was that?

482
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:25,605
(Sensei)
Dwight.
Yes!

483
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:26,815
No way.
One point.

484
00:18:26,856 --> 00:18:28,858
All right. That's the way you
want to do it?

485
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,695
Two more!
You want to play dirty, huh?
Okay, game on, man.

486
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,071
Sweep the leg.

487
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,531
I'm coming
at you, man.

488
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,659
[exhaling briskly]

489
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:41,579
Ha!
Okay, purple belt.

490
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,290
Okay.
I got it.

491
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,500
No.
I got his pants.

492
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,878
That was my pants.
No points for pants.

493
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,130
Dwight, you have--
No, look.

494
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:53,299
No, you have something.
You have something.

495
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,301
God, you look like such
an idiot.

496
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:58,221
[both yelling]

497
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:01,182
[Michael panting]

498
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,184
Ha!

499
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:07,689
[exhales]

500
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:13,611
[both grunting]

501
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:22,162
Huh, huh, huh, huh,
huh, huh!

502
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,246
Come on.

503
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:24,748
Against steel
you cannot penetrate.

504
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:28,168
Huh, huh, huh, huh,
Huh, huh, huh, huh!

505
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:30,670
Oh, nice try!
Huh, huh, huh, huh!

506
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:33,798
[pants, yells]

507
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,841
Clean technique,
gentlemen.

508
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,343
Come on. Do that again.
Do that again.

509
00:19:36,384 --> 00:19:37,552
I dare you.

510
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:39,346
Ha!

511
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:42,182
Okay, break.
Break. No holding.

512
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,851
Oh, you can't see?
You can't see?

513
00:19:44,893 --> 00:19:46,811
One point. Two points.
Three points.

514
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,022
(Sensei)
Break.

515
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:52,275
I win. I win.

516
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,194
No, you didn't.

517
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:55,362
No you--

518
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,447
Eight point.
Nine point.

519
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,115
[hocking up phlegm]

520
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:00,492
Stop it. No.

521
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,327
Come on. Michael!

522
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,453
Open your mouth.
No, Michael!

523
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:04,412
[hocking up phlegm]

524
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:05,789

00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,052
[exhaling rapidly]

527
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:24,015
You talkin' to me?
You talkin' to me?

528
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:26,518
Raging Bull.Pacino.

529
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,186
Oh, I want that footage.
I want it.

530
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:29,437
I need it.

531
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,064
Oh, I have to get back
to work.

532
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,857
I have lots of work.
Oh, oh, oh.

533
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,442
Check this out.
Come here.

534
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,278
There he is.
Mr. Temp.

535
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,323
Having lunch by the car.

536
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,450
Let us play with him.

537
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,244
See what we can learn.

538
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,205
[line trilling]

539
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:54,379
Oh, we're playing
phone tag.

540
00:20:54,421 --> 00:20:56,256
(female voice)
Seven new messages.

541
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:57,674
First new message.

542
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:01,094
(Michael)
Hi, Ryan. This is
Saddam Hussein.

543
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,595
(female voice)
Next message.

544
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:05,223
(Michael)
Hey, Ryan. This is
your girlfriend.

545
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:07,350
And I'm mad.

546
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,707
Stan the Man.

547
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:32,125
Hi, Michael.
Did you hear about the fight?

548
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,544
Well, wasn't much
of a fight, actually.

549
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:36,004
(Stanley)
No, are those purchase--

550
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:38,048
I opened a big ol' can
of whup-ass on him.

551
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:40,383
Huh?
I went medieval on his hiney.

552
00:21:40,425 --> 00:21:42,177
Okay, are those
purchase orders signed?

553
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,346
(Michael)
Hey, Stanley, I don't tell you
how to do your job, do I?

554
00:21:44,387 --> 00:21:46,264
Look, I just wanna have a job,
Michael.

555
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:47,682
If we don't get these
purchase orders--

556
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:51,478
Grow a pair, Stanley.
Right?

557
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:52,812
You're not gonna downsize

558
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,064
because I miss
a lot of deadlines.

559
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:57,067
It's not how
business works, okay?

560
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,693
Okay.

561
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,820
For the record,
let me just say

562
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:03,406
Michael Scott has no honor.

563
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:06,951
If he lived in Japan,
he would be an outcast.

564
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:10,497
My emergency contact
is Tod Pecker.

565
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:13,458
Tod F. Pecker.

566
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,502
You know what
the F standings for?
Fudge?

567
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,128
[knock on door]

568
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,130
Uh, come in.

569
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,675
Oh, hey,Karate Kid.

570
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:22,884
The Hilary Swank
version.

571
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:24,928
Hi. How are you?

572
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,681
I need to change my emergency
contact information

573
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:29,349
from Michael Scott.

574
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,476
Okay, to what?

575
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:34,896
Just put...the hospital.

576
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:38,024
Contact number,
just put 911.

577
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,734
[pen scratching out
information]

578
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,820
He is such a sore loser.

579
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,321
You heard obviously

580
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,990
that I mopped the floor
with him this afternoon.

581
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,703
You know what,
um, do yourself a favor.

582
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,538
Just leave me
as his contact

583
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:52,997
and I will call
the hospital.

584
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,000
Cut out the middleman.

585
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:57,043
[pen scratching out
information]

586
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:02,340
Good night, Toby.

587
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,009
(Toby)
Bye, Kelly.

588
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:14,519
(Kevin)
Later, Jim.

589
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,146
Later, Kev.

590
00:23:22,777 --> 00:23:23,737
Have a good weekend.

591
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:25,780
Yeah, you too.

592
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,251
[knocks at door]
Yeah.

593
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:39,919
I have the emergency
contacts.

594
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:41,463
Just lay 'em
on the chair.

595
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,631
I'll take it from here.

596
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,425
So what you up to
this weekend?

597
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:48,428
Uh, hanging out
with some friends probably.

598
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,097
Well, if you do anything crazy,
give me a shout.

599
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,932
Yeah. All right.
I will, um, see you Monday.

600
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:55,435
All right. Bye.

601
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:58,104
[breathes deeply]

602
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:03,068
All right, here you go,
princess.

603
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,487
Just finished
with part one.

604
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,073
This is what you had Ryan do.

605
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:09,657
Yes, under my tutelage.

606
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:12,243
But what about the other stuff?
That has to be in today.

607
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,412
If you didn't badger me
with so many questions, Pam,

608
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:17,123
I could be done with it
by now.

609
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:36,059
Dwight.

610
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,602
Michael,
did you finish yet?

611
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:39,979
This close. Dwight, may I
speak with you for a minute?

612
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:41,356
Uh, I'm busy.

613
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,191
Well, busier.
But I'm making the time.

614
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,068
Michael, can't your
conversation wait till Monday?

615
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,486
We want to go home.

616
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,988
Well, you don't even have
anybody to go home to, Toby.

617
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,366
The shipping place closes
in a half hour.

618
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:55,453
I know. But I've been carrying
the load on my back all day.

619
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:58,915
And if everyone would just
chip in a little bit,

620
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:01,418
might help me out.

621
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:02,502
What do you say?

622
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:03,920
Let's gang bang
this thing and go home.

623
00:25:03,962 --> 00:25:06,297
Good? Dwight.

624
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:13,930
This is illegal.

625
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,473
I don't care.

626
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:21,146
I have been testing you
the entire day.

627
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,522
Did you know that?

628
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,526
Of course.

629
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:29,070
And I'm happy to say
that you passed.

630
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:30,488
So effective immediately,

631
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,032
I am promoting you

632
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:34,492
from assistant
to the regional manager

633
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,286
to assistant
regional manager.

634
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,455
[gasps]

635
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,458
Michael...

636
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:42,876
I don't know--

637
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:44,544
I know. I know. I know.
I know.

638
00:25:44,586 --> 00:25:45,879
I wouldn't be offering it

639
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,589
if I didn't think
you could handle it.

640
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,965
I can handle it.
I can.

641
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,592
I know. Okay.

642
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,886
[sighs]
Wow.

643
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:55,722
So I guess this'll
just be my office.

644
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:57,015
No.

645
00:25:57,057 --> 00:25:59,059
No. Title change only.

646
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,560
I'll have Pam
send out a memo.

647
00:26:00,602 --> 00:26:02,645
No. No. Three month
probationary period.

648
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:05,565
Let's just not tell anybody
about this right now.

649
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:06,483
Just a formality?

650
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,860
Absolutely.
But not really.

651
00:26:08,902 --> 00:26:10,487
Michael...

652
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:17,786
I have so much
to learn from you.

653
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:20,038
Yes, you do.

654
00:26:22,957 --> 00:26:25,919
Thank you...

655
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,962
sensei.

656
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:33,927
And ditto.

657
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,387
I told Dwight

658
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:37,097
that there is honor
in losing,

659
00:26:37,138 --> 00:26:39,766
which as we all know
is completely ridiculous.

660
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:43,561
But there is however honor
in making a loser feel better,

661
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:46,356
which is what I just did
for Dwight.

662
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:49,776
Would I rather be
feared or loved?

663
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:52,153
Um, easy. Both.

664
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:55,490
I want people to be afraid
of how much they love me.

665
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:58,702
And I think I proved that today
at the dojo.

666
00:26:58,743 --> 00:27:00,036
Typewriter torture.

667
00:27:00,078 --> 00:27:01,287
Sensei, help.
Typewriter torture.

668
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:02,622
No.
Typewriter.

669
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,086
As a boss, I'm always
telling my employees,

670
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,504
"No pain, no gain."

671
00:27:09,546 --> 00:27:10,672
And if that's true,

672
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:13,091
Dwight gained
an awful lot today.

673
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,259
A lot.

674
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,219
He gained a lesson.

675
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:17,846
Don't mess with me.

676
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,556
He gained knowledge.

677
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:21,933
See what happens
when you mess with me?

678
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:24,644
And he gained pain.

679
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:28,481
Which is what happens
when you mess with me.

1
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,643
- Hello.

2
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,603
Pammy want a cracker?
[bawks like chicken]

3
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,188
- No, thanks.
You got a package.

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,900
- Ooh, Pam with the dirty talk.
[laughs]

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,194
- And he's lining it up.

6
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,363
Seems pretty straightforward
from here.

7
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,073
[whispering]
If Michael Scott sinks it,

8
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,576
he'll win a Buick
signed by Tiger Woods.

9
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,703
- Oh!
- Oh, he totally misses.

10
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,204
- [whispering]
No, he meant to put it

11
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:41,041
right next to the hole.
That's much harder to do.

12
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:43,043
- [gasps] Ah, interception!

13
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,253
He shoots, he scores. Yeah!

14
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,297
Michael, try it like this.

15
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,257
This'll be much harder.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,884
I don't want to chip my mug.

17
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,220
Please get that off the floor.

18
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,849
All right, Jack Nicholson
for Bud A.

19
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,435
- [whispers]
Jack Niklaus.

20
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:04,272
- It's a celebrity tournament.

21
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,357
Mm.
- I got it.

22
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:09,110
[clears throat] No problem.

23
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:10,153
- You see it?
- Oh, man.

24
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,155
It's really back there.

25
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,531
Yeah.
- Do you feel it?

26
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,741
- I can barely--

27
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:18,661
[ceramic shatters]
- Gah, damn it, Dwight.

28
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:23,083
That's great.

29
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,417
- Should I clean out my desk?

30
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:35,053
- That won't be necessary.

31
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,056
[upbeat piano music]

32
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:45,105
* *

33
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,615
- Most of that is good.

34
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,533
- Not today, Kevin.

35
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:42,954
I cannot be around carbs today.

36
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,289
You know what one loaf of bread

37
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,082
would do to my abs?

38
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,755
- I'm almost there,

39
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,214
so we should have
plenty of time

40
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,091
to go over the presentation.
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,634
- And, uh,
[clears throat] excuse me.

42
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,802
I've also confirmed
the meeting

43
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,054
this afternoon at 4:00 pm.

44
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,638
- Conflict.

45
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,557
- What?
- I have a conflict with that.

46
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,143
- What do you mean?
- Uh, pajama party.

47
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,604
At the Playboy Mansion.
With the bunnies.

48
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,147
- Michael...

49
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,732
I need you
to take this seriously--

50
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,108
- I can't get out of it.

51
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,526
- Michael.
- Okay, all right.

52
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,944
- Are you hearing me?
- I'm hearing you.

53
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,279
Meeting confirmed.
- This is very important.

54
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,365
- Meeting confirmed.

55
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,617
Would you like
your confirmation number?

56
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,826
Please grab a pen

57
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,161
because I will only be
repeating this once.

58
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,162
- I'll see you in ten minutes.

59
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:26,081
- 4-2-8-9-7--okay.

60
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,165
[laughs]

61
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,249
What is a closer?

62
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,377
A closer is a sales term

63
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,588
for someone
who always gets the job done.

64
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,383
And that is me.

65
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,759
A-B-C.

66
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:41,262
Always be closing.
"Glengarry Glen Ross."

67
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,973
Hey, gimme the Glen Ross leads.

68
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,434
"No way,
they're just for closers."

69
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:47,560
Do you know
who you're talking to?

70
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,728
I'm Michael Scott.

71
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,356
"Really?
Well, take any lead you want."

72
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:53,733
No thanks, I don't need 'em.

73
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,194
Because I have a client list

74
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,739
right here in my computer.

75
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,616
[exhales]

76
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,410
So, suck on that.

77
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,587
- Hey.

78
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,672
- Hi.

79
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,633
- What are you doing?

80
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,759
- I don't know.

81
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,178
I think I was just
staring at my desk.

82
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,555
- Really?

83
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,889
Do you want
to get back to that?

84
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:26,224
I could go. I should go.

85
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,684
- Yeah, do you mind leaving?
- Not at all.

86
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:29,436
- It's very important.
- Mm-hmm.

87
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,354
I'm sorry to interrupt.

88
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,314
- Hey, have they left
for the big meeting yet?

89
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,358
I got Michael's lucky tie.

90
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,485
- No, they're in
the conference room.

91
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,820
- Okay.
- Wait.

92
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:39,988
Are those Michael's Levi's?

93
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,824
- Yeah.
Who dry-cleans jeans?

94
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:44,325
- Michael and his jeans.

95
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,119
He gets in them and

96
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,996
I'm not exactly sure
what happens,

97
00:04:48,038 --> 00:04:49,581
but I can tell you,

98
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,750
he loves the way he looks

99
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,251
in those jeans.

100
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,920
I know that's why
he started casual Fridays.

101
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,213
I'll take those.

102
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,424
Thanks.

103
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:06,264
- This is a projection
of the county's needs.

104
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,225
- Wow, graphs and charts.

105
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,353
Somebody's really
been doing their homework.

106
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,937
Looks like "USA Today."

107
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,899
- 13 schools, 2 hospitals.

108
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,817
- So, this possible client
they're talking about.

109
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,902
Actually, a big deal.

110
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,320
It's Lackawanna County.

111
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,280
Our whole county.

112
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,615
And if we get this,

113
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,494
they might not have
to downsize our branch.

114
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:31,081
And I could work here
for years.

115
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:36,211
And years and...years.

116
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,921
- So, when we get to
the Radisson,

117
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,965
I'd like to--
- Oh, I changed it to Chili's.

118
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,300
- Excuse me?

119
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,803
- Radisson just gives out
this vibe.

120
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,971
It's like, "Oh, I'm doing
business at the Radisson."

121
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,265
It's kinda snooty, so...

122
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,684
- You had no right
to do that, Michael.

123
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:54,479
- Here's the thing,
Chili's is the new golf course.

124
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,356
It's where business happens.

125
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:59,359
"Small Businessman Magazine."

126
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,819
- It said that.

127
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,153
- It will. I sent it in.

128
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,823
Letter to the editor.

129
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:05,907
- All right.

130
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:08,535
But you will let me
run this meeting.

131
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,328
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

132
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,038
Power trip.
- What?

133
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,874
- What is it like to close
a really big sale?

134
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:19,087
Think of the best orgasm
you ever had in your life.

135
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,424
And divide it in half.

136
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,800
It's that good.

137
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:27,137
- She had done
a background check on me.

138
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:28,805
She had it printed out.
- No.

139
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,682
- Yeah, and she was
asking me about stuff

140
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,726
line by line
while we were having dinner.

141
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,728
- That is unbelievable.
- What's going on?

142
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,188
- We are doing
worst first dates.

143
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,898
- Oh, my God, I win.

144
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,443
Okay, it was a minor league
hockey game.

145
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,236
He brought his brother.

146
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,696
And when I went
to the bathroom,

147
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,448
the game ended,
and they forgot about me.

148
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,615
- Okay, that's a joke.

149
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,035
- No, they had
to come back for me.

150
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,037
- Wait, when was this?

151
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,081
- Um...

152
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,375
it was not that long ago.

153
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,626
- Wait, not Roy.

154
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:03,673
Say it's not your fiancé.
[laughing]

155
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:06,009
- I always knew Pam
has refused to go

156
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,053
to sports games with Roy.

157
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,389
But I never knew why.

158
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,849
Interesting.

159
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,810
- Oh, that is messed up.
- [laughs]

160
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,479
- Ha, ha.

161
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,564
Who's next?
- Pam, that's awful.

162
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,067
- What was my worst first date?

163
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,235
Um...

164
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,196
it was a couple years ago.

165
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,489
It was a lunch date.

166
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,825
Actually, it was
right down here at Cugino's.

167
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,827
And we had just met

168
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,373
and we really hit it off.
It was...

169
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:40,710
kinda nice. Um...

170
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,254
and, uh, then,
as it turned out,

171
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,590
it wasn't even a date
because...

172
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:47,801
she was actually in love
with someone else.

173
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:52,097
So...best first date's
also my worst first date,

174
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,725
oddly enough. [chuckles]

175
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,894
- Okay, let's do this thing.

176
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,020
Wish us luck.

177
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,772
- Good luck, Michael.
Good luck, Jan.

178
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,981
- Thank you.
- [quietly] Kiss ass.

179
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,110
Okay...probably going
to go late tonight.

180
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,903
Burning the midnight tequila.

181
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,656
So, I think you all
could just take off now.

182
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,783
- Michael, this shouldn't
take more than an hour.

183
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,034
- Well...
- Do you always shut down

184
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:15,912
the entire office
when you leave for an hour?

185
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,790
- No, no, that would not
be efficient.

186
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:20,834
Actually, they just don't
get very much work done

187
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,962
when I'm not here.

188
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,130
That's not true.

189
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,798
I know how to delegate.

190
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,843
And they do more work
when I'm not here.

191
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,553
Not more.

192
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,638
The same amount of work is done

193
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,725
whether I am here or not.

194
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,351
Hey, everybody, listen up!

195
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:39,769
This is what we're gonna do.

196
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,272
You sit tight until I return.

197
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,398
Sound good?

198
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,399
Doesn't matter.

199
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,692
It's an order.

200
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,986
Follow it blindly. Mm-ha-ha!

201
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,113
Okay?

202
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,740
All right, ciao.

203
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,782
Adios!

204
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,869
- So, which way is Chili's?

205
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,370
- Ah, I'll drive.

206
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,538
- No, that's all right.
I wanna leave

207
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,497
straight from there.
- It is just

208
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,832
a couple blocks away, so--

209
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:02,417
boy, you really don't know
Scranton, do you?

210
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,835
- I know Scranton.
- At all.

211
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,545
Have you ever been
to Scranton, Jen?

212
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,880
- If it's a couple blocks away,

213
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,256
we can go together.
- Dur-de-dur-de-dur. Okay.

214
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,884
Jan Levinson-Gould.

215
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,177
Jan is cold.

216
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,095
If she was sitting
across from you on a train,

217
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,723
and she wasn't moving,
you might think she was dead.

218
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,851
And I want to be the guy
sitting across from her

219
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:23,355
who reaches out and just
punches her in the chest

220
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,982
and gets her heart going again.

221
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,567
[sighs loudly]

222
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:29,444
Remember in high school,

223
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,820
driving around in a convertible

224
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,990
was like the coolest thing
you could do.

225
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,158
Remember?
- * I'm feeling so good *

226
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,536
* I can't even take it *

227
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,372
- What high school
did you go to?

228
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,165
Catholic girls' school?

229
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:46,503
- Uh...

230
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:50,382
- You keep reading that,
you're gonna get carsick.

231
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,258
Oh, you know what? Reminds me.

232
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,886
We should come up with
a signal of some sort.

233
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,096
- Why would we need a signal?

234
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,847
- Well, in case one of us
gets into trouble,

235
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:59,516
the other one can signal--

236
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:00,725
- What kind of trouble
are you planning on

237
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,102
getting in, Michael?

238
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,478
- Well, it could be
either of us.

239
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,646
- You're gonna let me
do the talking,

240
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:05,980
we agreed on that.

241
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,817
- Yes.

242
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,193
[radio playing loudly]
- * Feeling so good *

243
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,529
* I can't even take it *
- It's too loud, Michael.

244
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,447
- What?
- It's too loud!

245
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,782
- I can't hear you
over the music.

246
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,325
Oh, right, we're almost there.

247
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,160
- * And my body's
burning up so hot *

248
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,621
* Nobody has to be
something they're not *

249
00:10:23,915 --> 00:10:27,544
- Do you think
they'll get the account?

250
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:36,720
How come you never answer me?

251
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,680
- I'm sorry, Phyllis.

252
00:10:38,722 --> 00:10:42,142
No, I don't think
they'll get the account.

253
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,607
- Hello? Christian?
- Yes.

254
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:50,775
- Thought that was you. Hi.

255
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:51,860
- Hi.
- Michael Scott.

256
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,278
This is Jan Levinson-Gould.

257
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,612
- Just Jan Levinson.

258
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,905
- No Gould?
- No.

259
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:57,741
Thank you very much
for meeting with us.

260
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,783
Have you been waiting long?

261
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,368
- No, not long.
- Good, good.

262
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,245
- Uh, Jan, what happened?

263
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,788
- Michael.
- Is Gould dead?

264
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,331
What, uh...
- Michael.

265
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,791
We got divorced, okay?

266
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,793
I'm so sorry, excuse me.
- Wow, you're kidding me.

267
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,712
Do you wanna talk about it?
- Michael.

268
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:12,505
Could we have
a table for three please?

269
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:13,798
- When did this happen?

270
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,175
- We're in a meeting.
- Okay.

271
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,551
- This way, please.

272
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,512
- All right, after you.
- Thank you.

273
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,809
- I thought we could start

274
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,478
by going over
the needs of the county.

275
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,854
- Right.

276
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:30,231
Well, Lackawanna County
has not been immune

277
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:34,319
to the slow economic growth
over the past five years.

278
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:36,696
So for us, the name of the game

279
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,616
is budget reduction.
- Awesome Blossom?

280
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,950
- What?

281
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:42,369
- I think we should share
an Awesome Blossom.

282
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,828
What do you say?
They are awesome.

283
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,705
You want to, Christian?
Awesome?

284
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:48,166
- Sure, sure.
- Okay, it's done.

285
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:49,709
Actually, Megan?

286
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,169
May we have an Awesome Blossom,
please?

287
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,253
Extra awesome?

288
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:53,463
Now it is done.

289
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:55,340
- So, if you have--
- Hey, I heard a

290
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,133
very, very funny joke

291
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,510
the other day.
You wanna hear it?

292
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,636
- Christian, you don't--

293
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,554
you don't have
to listen to this.

294
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,056
- It's okay.
I like jokes.

295
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,349
- Okay.

296
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,600
- Just the one.

297
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,143
- Just one joke? Okay.

298
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,812
Well, if it's just
gonna be one...

299
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,606
I will think of
a different joke.

300
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:16,403
Um...

301
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,862
- Dunder Miflin,
this is Pam.

302
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,197
- Pam, it's Michael.
I need you to go

303
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,950
into my office
and check some data for me.

304
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,410
- Okay.

305
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:25,370
Um, you want me to read 'em?

306
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,663
- Yes.
- Okay.

307
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,748
Um, a fisherman
is walking down 5th Avenue

308
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,500
leading an animal behind him.
- Nope!

309
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,711
Nope, told it.
Not as good as you think.

310
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,170
Pick another one.
- Okay.

311
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,256
There's a transcript
between a Naval ship--

312
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,717
- Oh, hey! Bingo.

313
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,718
And a lighthouse.

314
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,052
Yes, that is hysterical.

315
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,887
Could you start that one
from the beginning?

316
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,222
- Sure. There's a transcript

317
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:46,224
between a naval ship
and a lighthouse.

318
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,578
- Is this real?

319
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:09,205
- It is a screenplay.

320
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,790
Starring himself.

321
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:12,584
- Agent Michael Scarn.

322
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,294
- Of the FBI.

323
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:15,420
- How long is this?

324
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:19,257
Oh, Pam, good work.

325
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,093
Oh, wait, stop.

326
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,595
Drawings.
- What is that?

327
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,804
- Oh, those are drawings,

328
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,891
in case the writing
didn't really

329
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:28,892
put a picture in your head.

330
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,643
And there he is, in the flesh,

331
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,687
Agent Michael Scarn.

332
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,647
Now we know what he looks like.

333
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,442
- First guy says,
"Well, I'm an astronaut,

334
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:38,943
so I drive a Saturn."

335
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:41,780
And the second guy says,
"Well, I am a pimp,

336
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,240
so I drive a cheap Escort."

337
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,284
And the third guy says,
"I got you both beat.

338
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,786
"I'm a proctologist

339
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,413
so I drive a brown Probe."

340
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:54,959
- [laughing] Oh, no!

341
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,921
Oh, my God, that's funny!

342
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,256
I almost had Awesome Blossom
coming out of my nose!

343
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,300
[laughing]

344
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,177
- Excuse me, could I have
a vodka tonic, please?

345
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,929
- Oh, drinks.

346
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,972
[both chanting]
Drinks, drinks, drinks, drinks.

347
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,057
- Vodka tonic.
both: Drinks, drinks, drinks.

348
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,726
- No, you know what?
Cancel that.

349
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:15,397
Uh, I hear...
[makes whooshing noise]

350
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:17,273
an El Niño coming in.

351
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,192
El Niños for everyone.

352
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,277
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Yes, mm-hmm.

353
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,447
Mm-hmm.
- I love El Niño margaritas.

354
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,449
[both laugh]

355
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,952
Yes!

356
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,453
Oh.
- Oh.

357
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:31,996
- Awesome!
- Isn't it?

358
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,832
- Mm!
- That dipping sauce.

359
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,750
- Do we all have our copy of

360
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,669
"Threat Level Midnight"
by Michael Scott?

361
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,045
[all murmuring assent]

362
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,006
All right,
let's get this started.

363
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,134
I'm gonna be reading
the action descriptions.

364
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,844
And Phyllis, I would
like you to play

365
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,053
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

366
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,346
- That's the character's name?

367
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,765
- You guys should
not be doing this.

368
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,684
- Why not, Dwight?
This is a movie.

369
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:53,935
I mean, this is

370
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,478
for all of America to enjoy.

371
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,730
- You took something

372
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,314
that doesn't belong to you.
- Dwight.

373
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,357
- Brought it in here,

374
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,567
made copies of it--
- Do you want

375
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,943
to play the lead role

376
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:05,697
of Agent Michael Scarn?

377
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,199
- Argh! [munching noises]

378
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,701
That's delicious!
- [laughing]

379
00:15:09,743 --> 00:15:10,702
- I love it.

380
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,121
- Can we--can we, uh...

381
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,789
could we talk about
your account, please?

382
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,541
- Okay, downer.

383
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,376
[chuckles]

384
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,128
- Are you upset, Jan?

385
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,255
- No! I'm--no, I'm not.

386
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,715
I'm not upset.
- I mean, it's okay.

387
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,758
I know what it's like.

388
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,217
You know,
my parents were divorced.

389
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,053
- Oh, really?
- It was tough at first

390
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,554
but then I sort of liked it,
you know?

391
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,014
I had two rooms.

392
00:15:31,056 --> 00:15:33,183
My dad's place was like a fort

393
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,060
and my mom's place
was home base.

394
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,228
- Did you have bunk beds?

395
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,230
- No. No, I didn't.
- Ah.

396
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,607
[sighs]
- That's too bad.

397
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,400
- I wish I'd had bunk beds.

398
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,485
- I'd get 'em now.

399
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,236
- Yes, that's too bad.

400
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,698
Okay, we would probably
be upset with ourselves

401
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,242
if we went this whole night
without talking business.

402
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,496
So, Dunder Miflin can provide

403
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,123
a level of personal service
to the county

404
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:59,751
that suppliers like Staples
can't match.

405
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,711
- Well, we are out
to save money.

406
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:02,796
- What's the bottom line?
- Blah!

407
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,465
Blah, blah, blah.
[speaking nonsense]

408
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:09,511
That's why I wanted
a signal between us.

409
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:12,430
So, I wouldn't have to
just shout nonsense words.

410
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,932
That's her fault.

411
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,600
Did somebody say

412
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:18,561
baby back ribs?

413
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,939
Hmm? Hmm?

414
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,232
- I don't think Christian

415
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:25,276
has time for that, Michael.
- I have time.

416
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,612
- * I want my baby back,
baby back, baby back *

417
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,698
both: * I want my baby back,
baby back, baby back *

418
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:30,949
* I want my baby back
baby back baby back *

419
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,119
- * Chili's baby back ribs *

420
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,662
- Location, a bank.

421
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:36,913
A man, very good looking,

422
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:38,832
runs into a bank
and kills a bank robber.

423
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,458
- I am Michael Scarn
with the FBI.

424
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,543
Freeze.

425
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,627
- Who's he saying "freeze" to

426
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:43,670
if the bank robber's dead?

427
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,255
- I don't know.

428
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,340
Inside the FBI,
Agent Michael Scarn

429
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,967
sits with his feet
up on his desk.

430
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,177
Catherine Zeta-Jones enters.

431
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:53,013
- Um, sir, you have
some messages.

432
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,140
- Not now!
- They're important.

433
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,517
- Okay, what are they?

434
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,893
- The first message is:

435
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,395
I love you.

436
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:01,521
That's from me.

437
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:02,897
- Not in a thousand years,
Catherine.

438
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:03,982
We work together.

439
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,734
And get off my desk.

440
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,402
Yes, I have acted before.

441
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,820
I was in a production
of "Oklahoma!"

442
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,405
in the seventh grade.

443
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:14,075
I played the part
of Mutey the Mailman.

444
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,744
They had too many kids,

445
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,496
so they made up roles
like that.

446
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,789
I was good.

447
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,291
Let's maintain this--

448
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,542
what are you--where you going?

449
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:23,835
- Home. It's after 5:00.

450
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,004
- Yeah, but Michael said

451
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,547
for us to stay
until he got back.

452
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,548
- Okay.

453
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,971
- What is--

454
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:36,014
when he comes back,

455
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,515
he's gonna see you're not here.

456
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,225
- Okay.

457
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,895
- Okay...

458
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,813
don't let it affect
your performance.

459
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:44,898
Here we go. Phyllis.

460
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,024
- The President called.

461
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,609
- Business or social?

462
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,277
- Both.
He has an assignment for you.

463
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,030
Very dangerous, maybe deadly

464
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,156
and he wants you to be

465
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,741
the best man at his wedding.

466
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:55,992
- Put him through.
But I'm only

467
00:17:56,034 --> 00:17:57,702
gonna talk business.

468
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:58,703
- Hey, Michael.

469
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,038
How's it hanging?

470
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,123
- It's hanging pretty good,
Mr. President.

471
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,459
I understand you have
a dangerous assignment

472
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:05,794
and I'm your man.

473
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:06,878
- I do.

474
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,546
I have a dangerous assignment.

475
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,256
Are you my man?

476
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,218
- You heard me the first time,
you joker.

477
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,803
- That would be pretty cool

478
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,221
if Michael starred in a movie

479
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:20,892
with Catherine Zeta-Jones.

480
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,936
She is so hot.

481
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:23,895
[all singing to tune of
"Happy Birthday"]

482
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,314
* Happy retirement to you *

483
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:29,359
* Happy retirement to you *
- Stop!

484
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,860
Everyone, I'm not retiring.

485
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:31,903
- Everyone stops singing

486
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:33,363
'cause he's not retiring.

487
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,074
- Well, if it isn't
my old partner,

488
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,785
Samuel L. Chang.

489
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:40,704
- Agent Michael Scarn,

490
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,580
you lost some weight.

491
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,749
- Thank you for noticing.

492
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,377
Now, keep me company
for one more mission.

493
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,712
- [whispering]
Hey, I have to work late.

494
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:51,047
- As soon as I blow out
these candles,

495
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:52,632
I'm retired.
- You're joking, right?

496
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,551
- Michael Scarn takes out
a nine millimeter gun

497
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,887
and shoots the cake to bits.
- [making gun noises]

498
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,055
- Ha, ha, ha.

499
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:01,891
Agent Michael Scarn,
you so funny.

500
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:03,018
Word.

501
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,644
- Michael's movie?

502
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:08,106
Two thumbs down.

503
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:14,195
[loud sucking noises]

504
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,781
- I bet 100.
- Sir,

505
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,742
the minimum bet is 1,000.

506
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,244
- If you had let me
finish my sentence,

507
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:22,787
you would have heard me say,

508
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,623
"I bet 100,000."

509
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,792
Sam, get me my money bag.

510
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:28,960
- Ha, ha, ha, ha.

511
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,046
Agent Michael Scarn,
you so funny.

512
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:32,756
You da bomb.

513
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,175
- Mm, yeah.

514
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,885
It kinda seems like

515
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:39,471
all the movies that I like.

516
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,473
- A man sitting
several seats down

517
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,975
who has a gold face
turns to Michael Scarn.

518
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,643
Uh, ooh.

519
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:48,104
Oscar, you wanna play
Goldenface?

520
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,147
- [clears throat]

521
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,273
Mr. Scarn,

522
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,691
perhaps you would be
comfortable

523
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,026
in my private jet.

524
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:54,986
- Yes, perhaps I would,
Goldenface.

525
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,654
Sam, get my luggage.

526
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:58,448
- I forget it, brotha.

527
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:00,283
- Samuel, you are such
an idiot!

528
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,077
You are the worst
assistant ever.

529
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,621
And you're disgusting, Dwigt.

530
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,082
Wait, who's "Dwigt"?

531
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,708
- Here's what
we think happened.

532
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,001
Michael's sidekick,

533
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:12,545
who all through the movie
is this complete idiot

534
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:15,340
who's causing the downfall
of the United States,

535
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,884
was originally named Dwight.

536
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,219
But then Michael changed it

537
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,012
to Samuel L. Chang

538
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,555
using a search and replace.

539
00:20:22,597 --> 00:20:25,016
But that doesn't work
on misspelled words.

540
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,894
Leaving behind one Dwigt.

541
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,397
And Dwight figured it out.

542
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:31,272
Oops.

543
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:34,776
- D-W-I-G-H-T.

544
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:35,777
Okay, you know what?

545
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:36,861
I am done with this.

546
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,363
That's it, the end.

547
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,824
- Well, some of us
wanna keep reading--

548
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:42,909
- Uh, you don't speak
for everyone, Jim.

549
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,577
Okay, announcement.

550
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:46,830
My uncle bought me
some fireworks.

551
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:49,708
And anyone who wants
to see a real show,

552
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,876
come with me outside now.

553
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:52,961
- That's actually a good idea.

554
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:54,921
We'll all take
a brief intermission.

555
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,339
Hey, are you hungry?

556
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,258
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

557
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,428
- And so after watching my mom
go through so much pain,

558
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,847
I decided to keep that promise

559
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,306
that I made to her.

560
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,599
And take care of her.

561
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:07,517
- Hoo.

562
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,728
Well, this brings us to Jan.

563
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,439
Truth or dare.
Tell us about your divorce.

564
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,732
- Oh, no, Michael.
Michael, Michael.

565
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,567
- Do, do.
- Michael, Michael, please.

566
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,193
No, really.
- Oh, hey.

567
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:18,903
So, you're not gonna play.
She's not playing.

568
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,196
- That's not fair.
- She's not playing the game.

569
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,489
- We'd been fighting
for a while.

570
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:23,366
He didn't want kids.
I knew that going into it.

571
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:24,743
But he also knew that I did.

572
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,120
So, I guess I thought that
he would change his mind.

573
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:29,289
He thought that
I would change mine.

574
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,749
- You didn't.

575
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,250
- I was stupid.

576
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:36,463
- No, no, you were not stupid.

577
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:39,090
Gould was stupid, right?
- That's right.

578
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:40,717
- You know?
- You were really brave.

579
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:43,136
I mean, you put
your arms out there.

580
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,096
You slit your wrist.
- That's true.

581
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,931
- You said,
"World, this is my blood.

582
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,059
"It's red, just like yours.

583
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,852
So, love me."

584
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:54,105
- I had plans to meet
a friend tonight.

585
00:21:54,147 --> 00:21:56,024
Which I had to cancel.

586
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:57,942
But this is cool, too.

587
00:21:57,984 --> 00:22:01,154
I'm not a complainer.

588
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,658
Wow.

589
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,077
- For the bugs.

590
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:08,286
- Nice.

591
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:11,998
That's excellent
because bugs love

592
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,208
my famous grilled cheese
sandwich.

593
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,085
- Yes!

594
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,128
Nice.

595
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,755
Okay, what's in here?

596
00:22:18,797 --> 00:22:20,799
- Uh, sliced tomato.

597
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,259
Uh, we happened to have
one around, actually.

598
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:26,680
I just had to wash off
the name "Angela"?

599
00:22:26,721 --> 00:22:28,014
- I guess that's
a tomato company.

600
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,307
- I guess you're right.

601
00:22:29,349 --> 00:22:30,266
- I can't remember
the last time

602
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:33,353
someone made me dinner.

603
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:37,691
- Whoa!

604
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:42,195
Yeah, whoo! Whoo!

605
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:44,864
[whooping and hollering]

606
00:22:44,906 --> 00:22:46,324
Whoo-hoo!

607
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:48,368
- Right down the street?
- Mm-hmm.

608
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,161
Kenneth Road, born and raised.

609
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,621
Spent my whole life

610
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:53,164
right here
in Lackawanna County.

611
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,792
And I do not intend on moving.

612
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:56,835
I know this place.

613
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,753
I know how many
hospitals we have.

614
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,256
I know how many
schools we have.

615
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,799
It's home, you know?

616
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:06,428
I know the challenges that
this county's up against.

617
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,138
Here's the thing about
those discount suppliers,

618
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,347
they don't care.

619
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:11,766
They come in,
they undercut everything.

620
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,935
And they run us
out of business.

621
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,729
And then, once we're all gone,

622
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:17,480
they jack up the prices.
- I know.

623
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:18,690
- It's bad.
- It's terrible.

624
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:21,026
- It is--you know what?
It really is.

625
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,402
- Uh--

626
00:23:22,444 --> 00:23:24,571
- I don't know.

627
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,239
I guess I could give you guys
our business,

628
00:23:26,281 --> 00:23:28,867
but you have
to meet me halfway, okay?

629
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,745
Because they're expecting me
to make cuts.

630
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:32,829
- Well,

631
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:35,165
corporate's gonna
go ballistic, but

632
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:38,418
you think we could, Jan?

633
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:42,005
- Bullets are flying
everywhere.

634
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,048
Ooh, wait, last page.

635
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:45,008
Big finish, here we go.

636
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,969
Agent Scarn kicks open the
plane door with a karate chop.

637
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:50,305
- A kick and a chop are two
totally different things.

638
00:23:50,347 --> 00:23:51,681
- Well, it's just
a movie, Dwigt.

639
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,266
- It doesn't make any sense.

640
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:55,018
- Yeah, now it doesn't
make any sense.

641
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,771
- Don't jump, Agent Scarn.
There are no parachutes.

642
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:00,065
- Just then, Agent Chang
gets a bullet in the head.

643
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,192
- Oh, so close to retirement.

644
00:24:02,233 --> 00:24:05,028
- Another bullet heads towards
Agent Michael Scarn

645
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,237
but he jumps out of the plane

646
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:09,949
without a parachute.

647
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,078
- Is that it?

648
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,538
- Yup, I guess so.

649
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:16,539
- Does he die?

650
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,208
- I sincerely doubt it.

651
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:19,334
- I have to say,

652
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,336
I think this is
a terrible movie.

653
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:23,380
- So, I guess
I'll see you

654
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:26,383
in...ten hours.

655
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,134
- What are you gonna do
with your time off?

656
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:29,678
- Travel.
- Yeah.

657
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:32,430
- I've been
looking forward to it.

658
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:34,891
It's gonna be...

659
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:35,934
really nice.

660
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,103
I'm gonna find myself.

661
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,396
- You have new music?

662
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,356
- Yeah.

663
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:43,149
Definitely.

664
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:46,111
[soft rock music playing]

665
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:52,575
* *

666
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:57,288
- See ya.
- Bye.

667
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:00,000
Thanks.

668
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,251
Yes!
- We did it.

669
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,377
- We got it!
- Nailed it.

670
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:03,336
- I mean, we got it!
- Nailed it!

671
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:04,504
Come here.
- Oh!

672
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:06,548
- [grunts playfully]
- [laughs]

673
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:10,510
- I am really...thrilled.

674
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,692
Let's go.
- What?

675
00:25:25,734 --> 00:25:27,277
Let's go. Go and--okay.

676
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:28,319
Where are we going?

677
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,155
Doesn't matter.

678
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:32,991
Goin' to the go-go.

679
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,535
Okay.

680
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:49,507
- Michael?

681
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:59,100
Michael?

682
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:02,979
Michael?

683
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,987
His car's not
in the parking lot.

684
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:14,699
I should check
the accident reports.

685
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,745
Who's this?

686
00:26:18,787 --> 00:26:21,456
Jan?

687
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,547
[car beeps]

688
00:26:35,804 --> 00:26:38,807
- My craft group
thinks I'm negative.

689
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:41,601
I'm gonna try to be
a better person.

690
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:47,107
Someone took my tomato.

691
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:53,071
Morning, Pam.

692
00:26:53,113 --> 00:26:55,323
- Michael loves
his entrance lines.

693
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:56,616
He always has one.

694
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,076
It's usually, like,

695
00:26:58,118 --> 00:26:59,619
some version of my name,

696
00:26:59,661 --> 00:27:02,205
like a pun, but not really.

697
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:06,292
And today, nothing.

698
00:27:06,334 --> 00:27:08,169
It was really odd.

699
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:09,629
- Made the sale last night.

700
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,631
- All right.
[clapping]

701
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,174
- How'd everything go here?

702
00:27:13,216 --> 00:27:14,175
- Good.
- Good.

703
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:20,265
No, nothing happened.

704
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,142
I swear!

705
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:23,560
Nothing happened.

706
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:25,520
What--I'm

707
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:28,106
totally being serious.

708
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:31,151
A gentleman does not
kiss and tell.

709
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:32,444
And neither do I.

710
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,696
[laughs] I'm--

711
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,072
No, seriously, guys, I'm not--

712
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:39,951
I don't wanna
go into it at all.

713
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,954
It's off limits.

714
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:44,622
Fine, I took her back
to her hotel,

715
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:45,790
and we made out

716
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:47,208
for a little while.
It was great.

717
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,793
I mean, she told me
about her divorce.

718
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:50,295
We talked for about five hours.

719
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:53,006
She fell asleep on my arm.

720
00:27:58,303 --> 00:27:59,471
Hello, Dwight.

721
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,848
- Did you do her?

722
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,351
- Who?
- Jan Levinson-Gould.

723
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:07,228
- Uh, no, no.

724
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,772
No Gould.

725
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:11,900
- Did you do her?
- This is none of your affair.

726
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:13,860
Because she is your boss.
- And she is your boss.

727
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:15,487
- And she is a woman.

728
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:19,366
She is a strong,
soft, thoughtful,

729
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:21,951
sexy woman.

730
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:23,828
And you know what?
I don't think I can sit here

731
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,413
and let you talk about her

732
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:26,873
that way without me

733
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:28,291
defending her honor.

734
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:31,044
Jan, I defend your honor.

735
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:33,004
Is that all?

736
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:40,136
- Jan didn't come back
for her car last night.

737
00:28:40,178 --> 00:28:41,888
- What?

738
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,848
- Could it be
that Agent Michael Scarn

739
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,684
has finally found
his Catherine Zeta?

740
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,811
- Oh, I don't know...

741
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:49,396
[phone rings]

742
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:50,605
Oh, my God.

743
00:28:50,647 --> 00:28:51,940
This is Jan's cell.

744
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:54,442
- No way.

745
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:56,277
- Dunder Miflin,
this is Pam.

746
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:58,738
- I know we have to register

747
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,866
as a consensual
sexual relationship with HR.

748
00:29:01,908 --> 00:29:04,911
My question,
do I do it as the man,

749
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:07,706
does she do it as my superior?

750
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:09,666
I don't know.
That leads to other issues

751
00:29:09,708 --> 00:29:10,917
that we may have

752
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:13,044
in our relationship.
It's, uh...

753
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:15,255
[phone ringing]
Excuse me.

754
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:16,381
Hello?

755
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:19,426
Hi. Just talking about you.

756
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,302
The camera, no.

757
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:23,138
Uh-huh.

758
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:24,556
How's traffic?

759
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:27,308
I miss you. What?

760
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,311
Okay.

761
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:32,147
Well...

762
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:35,358
if it was a mistake,
it was a wonderful mistake.

763
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:39,195
No.

764
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:40,864
Just...

765
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:44,367
No, I did not intentionally
get you drunk.

766
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:48,038
Mm-hmm.

767
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:49,456
No, no.

768
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:51,624
This is just a fight.

769
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:52,709
This is just a first fight

770
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:55,628
of many fights
we're gonna have.

771
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,672
Right.

772
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:59,716
No.

773
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:00,884
You--I don't understand.

774
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,802
You wanna see other people.

775
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,262
Only other people.

776
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:05,972
Wha--okay.

777
00:30:06,014 --> 00:30:07,515
I think you're still
a little bit drunk.

778
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:10,643
Excuse me. Excuse me?

779
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,354
I think you're st--yes.

780
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,022
Why don't you
just come back here?

781
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:15,398
We can go to the hotel.

782
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,816
Have a few drinks.

783
00:30:16,858 --> 00:30:19,527
No, I didn't
slip you something!

784
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:20,653
- Some might even say we had

785
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:22,697
our first date last night.

786
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,074
- Oh, really?
- Really.

787
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:26,034
- Why might some say that?

788
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:27,494
- 'Cause there was dinner.

789
00:30:27,535 --> 00:30:29,579
By candlelight.
- Mm-hmm.

790
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:32,874
- Dinner and a show
if you include Michael's movie.

791
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,459
And there was

792
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:36,336
dancing and fireworks.

793
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:39,881
Pretty good date.
- We didn't dance.

794
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:40,840
- You're right,
we didn't dance.

795
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:44,511
It was more like...swaying.

796
00:30:44,552 --> 00:30:45,929
But still romantic.

797
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:50,058
Swaying isn't dancing.

798
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,184
- At least I didn't leave you

799
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:53,395
at a high school hockey game.

800
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:00,777
- I have some faxes
to get out.

801
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:05,865
- Oh, come on, Pam, I--

802
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:08,159
Okay, we didn't dance.

803
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:09,869
And I was totally joking,
anyway.

804
00:31:09,911 --> 00:31:12,163
I mean, it's not really a date

805
00:31:12,205 --> 00:31:15,792
if the girl goes home
to her fiancé.

806
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:17,085
Right?

807
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,768
- Did I? Yeah.
I closed a huge account once.

808
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,937
Xerox.

809
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:39,566
Hundreds of millions
of dollars.

810
00:31:39,607 --> 00:31:40,692
There was some
confusion though.

811
00:31:40,734 --> 00:31:42,110
They thought
they were selling to me

812
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:44,446
and I thought
I was selling to them.

813
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:46,781
But, wow, still.

814
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,575
That was a night.

1
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:16,016
[breathing rhythmically]

2
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,984
You should get
one of these.

3
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,819
No.
Thank you.

4
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,946
Do you even know
what this is?

5
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:31,489
It is a fitness orb,

6
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,367
and it has completely
changed my life.

7
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:35,827
[sighs]

8
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,039
Forget everything you thought
you knew about ab workouts.

9
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,040
Done.

10
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:41,332
This ab workout

11
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,711
is specifically designed
to strengthen your core.

12
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:45,837
Sorry.

13
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,672
All right.

14
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,840
Numerous health benefits.

15
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,469
[breathing rhythmically]

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,054
Strengthens your back.
[exhales]

17
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,723
Better performance in sports.
[exhales twice]

18
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,850
More enjoyable sex.

19
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,352
You're not having sex.

20
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:03,480
[scoffs]

21
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,482
Plus improves
your reflexes.

22
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,776
See, I would've
caught that.

23
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,445
Okay, you know what,
uh, how much is that?

24
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,864
It's only 25 bucks.
Wow.

25
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,283
Um, okay.

26
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,001
[soft piano music]

27
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:31,800
* *

28
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,726
[upbeat music]

29
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:48,733
* *

30
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,285
Oscar, I'm ready for you.

31
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,416
(Oscar)
Today is performance
review day company-wide,

32
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,127
and I'm a little concerned
about my review.

33
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,005
I exceeded my sick days
and my personal days

34
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,048
because I just
couldn't take it.

35
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,635
(Oscar)
And I don't have a good answer
for him when he asks me.

36
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,681
[inhales deeply]

37
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:20,640
So.

38
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:21,558
Michael, I don't know
what to say.

39
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,101
Um, you're in accounting.

40
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,269
Yes.
I'm in accounting.

41
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,895
And I'm sorry about
all the extra days.

42
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,188
I know I'm past my limit.

43
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,607
So good, good, good.
Something to work toward.

44
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,234
Being here more.

45
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,069
I'm a big believer in people
being here more.

46
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,279
Yes.

47
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,322
[paper rips]

48
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,539
[tape rips]

49
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:53,548
[paper rustling]

50
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,634
Do you know what this is?
Yes.

51
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,636
No, you don't.
Then why the question?

52
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,349
This is a visual aid
for my performance review.

53
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,476
Budget is tight and
if anyone is getting a raise,

54
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,603
it is gonna be a fight
to the death,

55
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,396
and I intend on winning
that fight.

56
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,275
Dwight.

57
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,610
Determined.

58
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,611
Worker.

59
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,737
Intense.

60
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:16,821
Good worker.

61
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,822
Hard worker.

62
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,990
Terrific.

63
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,241
Dwight.

64
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,912
I have one, too.

65
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,876
[marker scribbling]

66
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,881
Jim.

67
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,217
Uh, Jim.

68
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,219
Is Jim.

69
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,554
My name is Jim.

70
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,015
[sighs]

71
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,642
It's a total waste of your M.

72
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,018
Really?
Yeah.

73
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,061
You have a better idea?

74
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,396
Yeah.
Magnificent worker.

75
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,398
Marvelous worker.
More money for this worker.

76
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,818
Man, I like this worker.

77
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,113
Mighty worker.

78
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,907
That's good.
Oof, that's good.

79
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,659
I'll use that.

80
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,790
Pam, could I see you
in my office?

81
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,712
(Pam)
It's performance review day
company-wide.

82
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,673
Last year,
my performance review started

83
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:20,301
with Michael asking me
what my hopes and dreams were,

84
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,178
and it ended with him
telling me

85
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,724
he could bench-press
190 pounds.

86
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,809
So I don't really know
what to expect.

87
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,728
Pam,
you're trustworthy.

88
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,603
Thank you.

89
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,022
And a woman.
Oh, no.

90
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,900
And I want you to listen
to a voice mail from my boss.

91
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,028
[Jan on answering machine]
Michael, it's Jan.

92
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,362
I guess I missed you.

93
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,281
I'll, uh, be there
this afternoon

94
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,033
for performance reviews.

95
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,743
I hope it's understood

96
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,911
that that will be
our only topic of discussion.

97
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:47,912
See you soon.

98
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:48,955
First impressions?

99
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:53,543
Uh, just off the top,

100
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:55,545
I think she'll be here
this afternoon.

101
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,589
(Michael)
My boss is coming in today.

102
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,923
The lovely
Jan Levinson-Gould.

103
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:00,633
W-well, no Gould.

104
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:03,136
The Gould has been
[chop noise] divorce.

105
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,263
Um, the awkward part

106
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,223
is that this
is the first time

107
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,226
we'll be seeing each other
since...

108
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,478
well.

109
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,688
Uh, it was really nothing.

110
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,940
We just sort of got caught up
in the moment.

111
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,569
The vulnerable divorcée
gives herself

112
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,571
to the understanding
with rugged good looks

113
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,031
office manager.

114
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,449
Just, uh,

115
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,077
she didn't want it to continue
for some reason.

116
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,413
We both didn't--
I didn't want--

117
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,332
we both didn't want it
to continue.

118
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,084
It was not professional.

119
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,003
Um, when people say
something's mutual,

120
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,630
it never is.

121
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,007
But this was mutual.

122
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,301
(Pam)
I guess I missed you.

123
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:46,304
I guess I missed you.

124
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,264
So she misses me.

125
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,641
She missed you.

126
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,520
But then, she goes on to say,

127
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,730
"That will be our only topic
of discussion."

128
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,191
That doesn't mean anything.
Those are just words.

129
00:05:58,233 --> 00:06:00,026
I have one idea
of what it means.

130
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,528
Okay. Yeah. What? What?

131
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,612
Well, I don't think
you're going to be

132
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:05,198
very happy with this.
Oh, great.

133
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,826
All right, well,
now I'm in a terrible mood.

134
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,661
[pen clicks]
[inhales deeply]

135
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,579
Let's do
your performance review.

136
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,790
Because she's conflicted.

137
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,375
She has to be
professional,

138
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,503
but she's fighting
feelings for you.

139
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,047
Ah. Why--
that's great news.

140
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,341
That--that--
then why would--

141
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,551
why would I not
like that?

142
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,303
Um, just cause
that you work together,

143
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,848
and it might be awkward.
Wow, wow.

144
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,726
All right, let's listen
to that again.

145
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,269
(Pam)
Michael, it's Jan.

146
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,645
I guess I missed you.

147
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,273
Oh, hey.

148
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,191
Listen, Jim.

149
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,985
Here's a little tip
for your performance review.

150
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:43,236
Okay.

151
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,822
Tell Michael that we
should be stocking more

152
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,825
of the double-tabbed
manilla file folders.

153
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:50,368
We don't have double-tabbed
manilla files folders.

154
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,369
Oh, yes we do.
No, we don't.

155
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,495
Yeah, it's a new product.

156
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,830
So you should just
suggest that to him,

157
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,749
and then he'll be sure
to give you a raise.

158
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,750
Uh-huh.

159
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,627
We'll, I'm not asking
for a raise.

160
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,713
I'm gonna actually be asking
for a pay decrease.

161
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,007
Uh, that is so stupid.

162
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,925
What if he gives it
to you?

163
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,345
I win.
Ugh.

164
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,763
You know what,

165
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,639
I am going to zone you out
for the rest of today, okay?

166
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,391
I need to stay focused.

167
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,560
And I don't have to see you
tomorrow or Sunday.

168
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,770
And please don't call me,

169
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,021
and we'll see how things go
on Monday.

170
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,566
[sighs]
Stupid.

171
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,611
Wait, wait. One thing.

172
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:28,073
Um, by tomorrow,
you mean Saturday, right?

173
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,240
Uh, duh.

174
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,533
Duh.

175
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,951
Today is Thursday.

176
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,496
But Dwight thinks
that it's Friday.

177
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,414
And that's what
I'll be working on

178
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,916
this afternoon.

179
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,460
Sometimes women say more
in their pauses

180
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:41,670
than they say
in their words.

181
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,588
Really.
Oh, yes.

182
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,006
Let's listen to it again.

183
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:48,009
And this time,
really listen to the pauses.

184
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,095
God, Stanley,
that's freakin' brilliant.

185
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,137
How do you know that?

186
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,348
Did you learn that
on the streets?

187
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,183
Sorry.
Oh, it's okay.

188
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,227
I did learn it on the streets.

189
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,603
On the ghetto, in fact.

190
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,897
No kidding.

191
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,483
It's all about my bonus.

192
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,612
Michael and Jan
definitely made out.
Oh.

193
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,155
Maybe more.
Ugh.

194
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,741
Oh, also, it is Thursday,

195
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,159
but Dwight thinks
it's Friday,

196
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,452
so keep that going.

197
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,037
Oh, yay.

198
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:20,834
Good work, Stanley.

199
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,627
Great performance review.

200
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,462
Stanley in the house,
everybody.

201
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,964
Whoo!

202
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,549
Angela, your turn.

203
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,135
(Angela)
I actually look forward
to performance reviews.

204
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,762
I did the youth
beauty pageant circuit,

205
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,181
and I enjoyed that
quite a bit.

206
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,976
I really enjoy being judged.

207
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:42,355
I believe I hold up very well
to even severe scrutiny.

208
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,440
Michael.
Yeah.

209
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,275
Jan's on the phone
for you.

210
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,361
Oh. Angela, you were totally
satisfactory this year.

211
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,405
[door slams]

212
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,157
Interesting.
Jan is calling me.

213
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,160
Maybe it wasn't
so mutual after all.

214
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,453
Yeah.

215
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,537
[Jan on speakerphone]
Michael.

216
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,956
Jan, to what do I owe
this pleasure?

217
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:02,167
I am returning
your many calls.

218
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,502
Well, hello to you, too.

219
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,005
Um, yeah, I was just, um,

220
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,673
I just wanted to get
some closure

221
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:12,218
on what transpired
between us at the meeting

222
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,179
we had in the parking lot
of the Chili's.

223
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,767
No.

224
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,852
No, we--we won't
be discussing that, Michael.

225
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,187
The only things
I want to talk about

226
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,521
during your performance
review

227
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,816
are your concrete ideas
to improve your branch.

228
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:31,029
Well, surely this, uh,
review is a formality

229
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,324
because of what happened, uh,

230
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,201
at our meeting in the
parking lot of the Chili's.

231
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,037
Review is anything but
a formality, Michael.

232
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,748
And, uh, I expect you
to forget anything

233
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,292
that you think may have
happened between us

234
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:47,712
and exhibit completely
professional behavior.

235
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,214
Been thinking about you.

236
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,423
Okay, that is an example

237
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,092
of completely unprofessional
behavior.

238
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,678
Mm, I don't see
how that's unprofessional.

239
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,679
Michael.

240
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,097
Yeah?

241
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,556
Are the cameras in there
with you in your office?

242
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,974
No, they are not.

243
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,561
Yes, they are.

244
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,562
[sighs]

245
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,605
[phone hangs up]

246
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,232
[dial tone droning]

247
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,109
That's my girlfriend.

248
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,153
I heard they made out
and had sex.

249
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,738
[whispering]
I heard they just made out.

250
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,906
That's it.

251
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,577
Well, I heard
they made out...

252
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,204
and had sex.

253
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,622
Don't talk about it.

254
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,583
Office romances
are nobody's business

255
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,252
but the people involved.

256
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,965
Romances?

257
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,051
Pam, I have ideas
on a daily basis.

258
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,344
I know I do.

259
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,681
I have a clear memory
of telling people my ideas.

260
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:41,641
Um, is there any chance

261
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:43,309
that you wrote
any of my ideas down,

262
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,602
like, in a folder?

263
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,146
Like, a idea folder?

264
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,147
Sorry.

265
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,816
That's unfortunate.
[inhales deeply]

266
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,943
[whispers]
How about the suggestion box?

267
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,611
There's tons of ideas
in there.

268
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,654
What suggestion box?

269
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,740
The suggestion box
that I put out,

270
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,242
and people could put in
suggestions anonymously.

271
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,618
Maybe there's prizes.

272
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,287
Oh, yeah.

273
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,164
Uh, I think I remember that
from back when I first started.

274
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,498
Why don't you find it

275
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,834
and then tell people
to get theirs?

276
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,794
Never mind. I'll tell them.
Hello, everybody.

277
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,046
Yeah.
Uh, attention, please.

278
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,547
Jan Levinson's coming

279
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:13,798
very soon.

280
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,799
And so we're going
to have

281
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,594
our weekly suggestion box
meeting.

282
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,347
So you can all get in
your constructive compliments

283
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,848
ASAP.

284
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,641
Don't you mean
constructive criticism?

285
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,642
What did I say?

286
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,977
You said constructive
compliments.

287
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,312
That doesn't make
any sense.

288
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,563
Well, Kelly,

289
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,814
that was neither constructive
nor a compliment,

290
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,484
so maybe you should stop
criticizing my English

291
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,153
and start making
some suggestions.

292
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,321
Okay?

293
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,530
Hey, Dan,
this is Jim.

294
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,824
It is about 11:15
and I wanted to know

295
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,534
what you were
up to tomorrow,

296
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:45,330
which is the 15th
and that is a...

297
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:47,040
Saturday.
Saturday.

298
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,667
So just let me know
what you're doing tomorrow,

299
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,001
Saturday, for lunch.

300
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,795
Okay, talk to you soon.

301
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,550
So that's...
Uh-huh.

302
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:58,843
That's great.
Yes, it is.

303
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,262
Yeah. You have fun?
Yes, I did.

304
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,766
Did you...go to first base?

305
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,435
Hell, yeah.
Oh, yeah?

306
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:08,520
Yeah.

307
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,688
Did you go to second?

308
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,481
What?
Second?

309
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,816
Kind of, yeah.

310
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:14,776
Over the shirt.

311
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,403
My elbow, but.

312
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:18,405
Okay. So close call on second.

313
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:19,406
Um...
[exhales deeply]

314
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,366
Was there an infield fly?

315
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,118
Um, yep.

316
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,202
Wait. Yes.

317
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:25,370
Pop-up?

318
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,580
No.

319
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,582
There--later, there was.

320
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:31,209
Really?
Yes.

321
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,170
So you got the signal
from the third base coach?

322
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,463
[chuckles]

323
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,758
You know what I'm saying, like,
if there was a, you know,

324
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,468
a fly out to deep right.

325
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,387
Mm-hmm.
You know?

326
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,432
A runner on second?
You tagged up, didn't he?

327
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,934
I didn't--you know, it was--

328
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,021
It was dark, for one thing.

329
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,815
[Jan talking on phone]

330
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,275
Okay.

331
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,569
Okay, bye-bye.
[flip phone clicks]

332
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,112
Would you please tell Michael
that I'm here?

333
00:12:59,154 --> 00:13:00,447
(Pam)
Sure.

334
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,073
Hi, Jan.
How are you?

335
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,074
Hi, Michael.
I'm good. How are you?

336
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,159
Good to see you.
Nice to see you.

337
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,410
Okay.

338
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:07,912
Okay, why don't we
just step into my off--

339
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,581
[chuckles]

340
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,082
We're going to go
in here.

341
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,584
Can we please go
into your office?

342
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,877
Yep.
Right after you.

343
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,128
Après vous.

344
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,967
[exhales deeply]

345
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,640
Oh, thank you.

346
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:28,892
It's nice
to see you.

347
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,893
Nice to see you too,
Michael.

348
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,519
Really?

349
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:32,479
Not like that.

350
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,314
Oh, well...

351
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,191
You know, Michael,
I think I need to make

352
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,484
something clear
right off the top.

353
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,736
I'm not going to discuss
anything with you

354
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,321
other than Dunder Mifflin
business.

355
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,489
All right.
Period.

356
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,656
Yup.

357
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:45,784
Do we understand
each other?
Absolutely.

358
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:46,951
I'm a little confused

359
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,328
because first it's, like,
all kissy-kissy.

360
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,788
And then it's, like,
all regret.

361
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,456
Because, "Oh, I regret that.

362
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,376
"But wait,
I'm still going to call you.

363
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:57,087
"But--but we're just
going to talk business.

364
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,296
"And I may come down there
and fire you

365
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,006
if you don't do your job."

366
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,468
But what were we talking about
when we first kissed?

367
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,844
Business.

368
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:05,929
So are you still
in the middle

369
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,930
of the performance
reviews then?

370
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,139
No, no, no.
I finished all of that.

371
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,265
I'm very fast.

372
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:10,975
I'm not too fast.

373
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,560
Not like wham, bam,
thank you, ma'am.

374
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:15,021
But I do say thank you,
ma'am.

375
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,233
But I'm not like, wham, bam.

376
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,276
Not that there's anything
wrong with wham, bam.

377
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,653
If it's consensual.

378
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,740
We're talking
about office stuff.

379
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,161
Can I ask you a question?
No.

380
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,996
This is a business question.

381
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,040
It's nothing personal.
I promise.

382
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:35,959
Fine.

383
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,336
Are you wearing
new perfume today?

384
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,131
How is that
a business question?

385
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,799
Well, you're wearing it
at the office.

386
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,260
And... [sniffs]
It...

387
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,929
I'm sorry, no offense,
but it's really sexy.

388
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,597
Please don't smell me,
Michael.

389
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,812
Hey, Jim.
Hey, how's it going?

390
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:57,063
Oh, my God.

391
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:58,273
Did you seed The Apprentice
last night?

392
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,816
Of course.
It's on every Thursday night.

393
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:01,067
So how can I miss it?

394
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,068
Can you believe
who Trump fired?

395
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,069
No.
That was unbelievable.

396
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,237
Who? Who was it?

397
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,238
Who did he fire?

398
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,032
You didn't see it?
No.

399
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,199
I went out and got drunk

400
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,451
with my laser tag team
last night.

401
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,535
Crap.

402
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,287
I never go out
on a Thursday night.

403
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,122
What the hell
was I thinking?

404
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:16,624
I don't understand--

405
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:17,709
[phone rings]

406
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:19,586
Hold on. Sorry.

407
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,338
Yes, Pam.

408
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,256
(Pam)
Michael, it's time for the
suggestion box meeting.

409
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,716
I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

410
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,343
I wish you wouldn't
interrupt.

411
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,469
You told me to buzz you

412
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,887
about the suggestion box
meeting

413
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:29,888
when Jan was here.

414
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,223
I did not--not--not use
those words.

415
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,808
Uh, I'd like to sit in
on that meeting.

416
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,893
Is it happening right now?

417
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,144
No, it's in,
like, 10 minutes.

418
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,479
Everyone's waiting
in the conference room.

419
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,481
[sighs]
Great. Very good.

420
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,780
What is this meeting for,
again?

421
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:47,947
(Dwight)
Do you want me to handle this?

422
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,032
No, I do not.

423
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,450
Why are we here, Oscar?

424
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:53,036
Because I value
your opinions.

425
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:54,329
And know a lot of you
don't think

426
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,663
that I read
your suggestions,

427
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:57,123
but I do.

428
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:00,126
Every week, I comb through
everything that you have to say

429
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,170
and I value your comments.

430
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,463
I just thought it would be nice

431
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,382
to do this together
for a change.

432
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,133
You read our suggestions
every week?

433
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,802
More or less, yeah. I do.

434
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,720
So let's take a look
at these suckers, shall we?

435
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,972
Oh, uh, question.
Do you want me to read them?

436
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:14,349
No, I'll read them.
Okay.

437
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:15,809
Can I take them out of the box?
I can take them out.

438
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,851
I'll take them out.

439
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,144
Can I hold the box?
I'll hold the box.

440
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:19,312
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Why don't you hold the box?

441
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,313
You wanna hold the box?
Please.

442
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,898
You happy?
You finally happy?

443
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,526
You gonna tell your stupid,
Amish cousin that you live with

444
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,902
that you got to hold
a box today,

445
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:26,903
you freakin' monster?

446
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:30,281
[takes deep breath]

447
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,701
Let's read 'em.

448
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:37,664
All right.

449
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,374
Number one,
what should we do

450
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,709
to prepare for Y2K?

451
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,086
What should we do
to prepare for Y2K?

452
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:44,421
I thought you read these
every week.

453
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,007
Well, obviously,
this one got stuck in the box.

454
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,383
That happens occasionally.

455
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,426
(Dwight)
It happens occasionally.

456
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:52,846
And, um, so one down.

457
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,140
Next suggestion.

458
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,225
"We need better outreach

459
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,144
for employees
fighting depression."

460
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,855
Okay, all right.
Enough with the jokes.

461
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:04,065
Nobody in here
is suffering from depression.

462
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,400
That sounds serious,
Michael.

463
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,569
Oh. Okay. Well, yeah?

464
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,945
Who wrote it?
Tom.

465
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,155
Tom. Then it is a joke

466
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,948
because there is nobody
in here named Tom.

467
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,324
(Phyllis)
Tom?

468
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,326
He worked in accounting up
until about a year ago.

469
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,831
[whispers]
Tom.

470
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,291
[imitates gunshot]

471
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,918
Oh, that guy?
That guy was weird.

472
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,919
All right, next suggestion.

473
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,796
Next suggestion.

474
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,673
Ar, badoo badoo.

475
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:30,717
You need to do something
about your B.O.

476
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:32,886
You need to do something
about your B.O.

477
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:36,556
Okay, now I don't know who this
suggestion is meant for,

478
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,892
but it's more
of a personal suggestion.

479
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,810
And it's not an office
suggestion.

480
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:42,562
Far be it from me
to use this as a platform

481
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,897
to embarrass anybody.

482
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:47,233
Aren't the suggestions
meant for you?

483
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,693
Well, Toby,

484
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:53,656
if by me you are inferring
that I have B.O.,

485
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:57,243
then I would say that that
is a very poor choice of words.

486
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:58,495
Uh, Michael,

487
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:00,246
he wasn't inferring,
he was implying.

488
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:01,414
You were inferring.

489
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:02,665
Was I, Creed?

490
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,292
Okay, well, you know what?

491
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:08,463
I am implying is that when
we're on an elevator together,

492
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,548
I should maybe
take the stairs

493
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,384
because talk about stank.

494
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,718
Not that I would ever

495
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,428
say something like that
in public

496
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,971
and I never have
and I never will,

497
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,014
I just think it's something

498
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,100
that we should all be aware of.

499
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:21,309
Okay?
[scoffs]

500
00:18:21,351 --> 00:18:23,019
Now that
we've learned this,

501
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,437
let's continue.

502
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,522
See, this is good.

503
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:26,731
We're learning,

504
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:28,650
and we're figuring
some stuff out.

505
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,443
You need to do something
about your coffee breath.

506
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:31,486
You need to do
something about--
Okay, no.

507
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:32,737
Shut up, shut up.
shut up, Dwight.

508
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,948
Okay, I don't think
you people are grasping

509
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,951
the concept
of the suggestion box.

510
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,078
Sometimes, you talk to us
real close.

511
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,081
Yeah?
Is that hard for you?

512
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:45,083
All right.
Well, when you have
coffee breath, it's hard.

513
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:47,419
Let's k--
let's keep going.

514
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,463
Yup.

515
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,464
What do we have here?

516
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:53,299
We have...

517
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:55,218
somebody's piece of gum.

518
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,386
Somebody put a piece
of gum in there.

519
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:58,972
This is not a--a garbage can,

520
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:00,640
this is the future
of our company.

521
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:03,685
This is not a place
for gum, okay?

522
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:05,603
I don't want to have
to read these tomorrow...

523
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,522
Yeah, who wants to come in
on a Saturday?

524
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:10,525
Yeah. What? No.
Okay.

525
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:12,777
Let's just--let's just push on,
shall we?

526
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,070
Pushing on.

527
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:16,573
Just gimme the next two.
Let's just keep it going.

528
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,702
Look on the supply shelf.

529
00:19:20,744 --> 00:19:21,703
What?

530
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:23,788
What is that?

531
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:26,082
All right, um, Ryan,

532
00:19:26,124 --> 00:19:27,876
look on the supply shelf,
would you?

533
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:28,877
Yeah.

534
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,384
It's another note.

535
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:37,719
Okay.

536
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,847
Look on the windshield.

537
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:41,806
Okay.

538
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,350
Does it specify
which windshield?

539
00:19:43,391 --> 00:19:44,601
I'll check them all.

540
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,606
[sighs]

541
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,070
(Dwight)
This ought to be good.

542
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:56,196
(Stanley)
Which one?

543
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:57,197
(Dwight)
There it is!

544
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,490
Where?

545
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,824
It's on the black one.
He doesn't see it.

546
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:00,867
(Stanley)
It's right there.

547
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,535
It's on the Miata!
He sees it.

548
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:05,330
(Dwight)
Go--okay, he's got it.

549
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,998
What does it say?

550
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,751
Look under the sink
in the men's room!

551
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,046
What I try to do
with these people...
[sighs]

552
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:16,549
Is get them to--to be honest

553
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:17,759
like that whole
coffee breath thing.

554
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,552
That's good, that's good,

555
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,805
You know what?
I drink a lot of coffee.

556
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,598
And it's not saying that I have
bad breath, it's just saying--

557
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,684
Frankly, I think that
this entire meeting

558
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:26,810
is a bit of a waste of time,
Michael.

559
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:27,936
Well, we haven't finished yet.

560
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:29,604
We've now been here 15 minutes.
Right.

561
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:31,064
We've just been sitting here
doing this.

562
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,524
Come on back, come on back.
These needless suggestions.

563
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,109
(Michael)
Well, we just have
a couple more.

564
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,237
All right, don't break any land
speed records getting back.

565
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:39,406
Okay, Stanley?
All right.

566
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,616
Next suggestion.
Next suggestion.

567
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,495
Don't--
Okay, that's blank.

568
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:46,538
Don't--just--

569
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,956
Don't sleep
with your boss.

570
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,418
Do you think
this is referring

571
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:52,794
to you boning Jan?

572
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:58,675
Okay, let me--
let me make something clear.

573
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:00,010
As embarrassing as this is,

574
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,428
I feel that it needs
to be said.

575
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,722
There is nothing romantic
or--or

576
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,265
sexual going on

577
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,975
with Michael and myself.
Well--

578
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,644
The other night, I gave him
a polite, congratulatory kiss

579
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:13,064
because he just closed
the biggest deal of his--

580
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:15,400
his career and--and--
and that's it.

581
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,735
Okay?

582
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,070
If anything else has been
inferred or implied,

583
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,238
it's just not true.

584
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,197
So.

585
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:23,950
Is everyone straight on that?

586
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,077
Crystal.

587
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,207
There's one more suggestion.

588
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,167
Press it.

589
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:35,628
You can, um--

590
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,173
Way to go, man.
Jan's really hot.

591
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,300
Okay, I think we're good.

592
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,218
I can't--I can't--
I don't understand
why you're so upset.

593
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,803
All right,
please sit down.

594
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,096
I'm going to sit over here.
You're going to sit over there.

595
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,222
Let me ask you this.
Please sit yourself down.

596
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:48,475
Let me ask you something.
What, Michael?

597
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,101
Where did you get your outfit?
[groans]

598
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:52,479
What is an office?

599
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,065
Is it a group of people?
Maybe.

600
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:57,776
Is it an idea?
Of course, yes.

601
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,445
Is it a living organism?

602
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:03,156
Exactly. Yes.

603
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:07,327
And any single-cell organism
has to have a spine,

604
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:08,995
and that's me.

605
00:22:09,037 --> 00:22:13,083
But the spine is always
controlled by a brain,

606
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,085
and that is Jan.

607
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:18,296
But the brain needs a heart,
and that is me again.

608
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:20,215
[chuckling]
So ironic.

609
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,592
You know what?

610
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:25,470
The heart is smarter
than the brain.

611
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:28,431
[clock ticking]

612
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:31,601
But the brain is so effin' hot.

613
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,186
Oh, my God.

614
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,813
When Dwight said that no one
wants to come in on Saturday?

615
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:35,980
Pam.
I almost lost it.

616
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,191
[chuckling]
That was too good.

617
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:41,319
Well, that is because that is
the gift that keeps on giving.

618
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,072
(Pam)
[laughing quietly]

619
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,533
Oh, my God.

620
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,076
I left today's paper
on my desk.

621
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:51,329
You mean yesterday's paper.

622
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,580
What?

623
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:53,957
Yes.

624
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,792
That is exactly what I mean.

625
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,837
Whoa.

626
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:02,048
You are very good
at what you do.

627
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,174
Thank you.

628
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,845
[chewing loudly]

629
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,388
Hey, temp.
Hey.

630
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:09,848
Look, we're twins.

631
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,808
Huh. [chuckles]
Cool.

632
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,060
Bet you I got mine
for less than yours.

633
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,937
I bet you did.

634
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:19,232
Mm, getting a little something
to calm the nerves?

635
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:20,942
What nerves?

636
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:22,569
For the performance review.

637
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,488
Oh, wait. You don't get one.
You're a temp.

638
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,698
Ha-ha.
[chuckles politely]

639
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,575
Actually, I had mine already.

640
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:29,826
You're lying.

641
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,703
Why would I lie about
a performance review?

642
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,413
Why would Michael give you one
before me?

643
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:34,664
I think because

644
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:36,166
my name is before yours
in alphabetical order.

645
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,917
[change clanking]

646
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:40,211
[sighs]
How did it go?

647
00:23:40,253 --> 00:23:42,255
Fine. He actually gave me
a small raise,

648
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:43,631
which I did not ask for.

649
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,675
[vending machine grinds]

650
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:48,345
It's stuck.

[chip bag crackling]

652
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,436
It's cool. It fell.

653
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:57,645
It's--

00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,197
[Motley Crue's "Wild Side"
playing on cheap stereo]

655
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,199
You're gonna give me
this raise.

656
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,700
I deserve this raise.

657
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:11,785

658
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:12,827

Yes! Yes!

660
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,790
Ha!

661
00:24:16,831 --> 00:24:18,083
The least you can do

662
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,001
is keep my salary consistent
with inflation.

663
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:21,670
Kah-ah!

664
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,004
Yes!

665
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:24,714
Why are you going to give me
this raise?

666
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,299
Why?

I just don't understand

673
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:47,404
why you have to pretend
like nothing happened.

674
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:50,323
Because nothing did, Michael.

675
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,242
I'm not going to say anything
more about it,

676
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,369
and I would advise
that you do the same.

No, Dwight. Come in.

What do you want,
Dwight?

683
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,046

you've been conducting

688
00:25:12,846 --> 00:25:14,264
all the reviews, Michael?

689
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:16,599
You want to talk now?
Good. Okay, Dwight, leave.

690
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:18,852
Uh, wait. I would like
to discuss my raise.

691
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:21,479
Why on Earth
would we give you a raise?

692
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,064
That is an excellent
question.

693
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,190
Thank you for asking.

694
00:25:26,943 --> 00:25:28,778
Let me bring up one word.

695
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,155
Dedication.

696
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,949
I have never...

697
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,284
been late.

698
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:37,871
Also, I have never
missed a day due to illness.

699
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:39,122
[sighs]

700
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:40,206
Even when I had
walking pneumonia.

701
00:25:40,248 --> 00:25:43,126
I even come in on holidays.

702
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,128
You do? How do you get in?

703
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,796
I have a copy of your key.

704
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:48,256
That's a serious offense.

705
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:51,301
That is a serious offense.
Very serious.

706
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:53,553
[shakily] As is
toying with a man's heart.

707
00:25:53,595 --> 00:25:55,472
Oh, Michael,
for God sakes.

708
00:25:55,513 --> 00:25:57,682
I'd also further like to talk
about my merits

709
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:58,975
in the workplace.

710
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:00,185
Okay, third wheel,
why don't you do that?

711
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,728
For instance,

712
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,104
the time I brought in deer
jerky for the whole office.

713
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:05,148
That was deer? Gross. Oh...

714
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:06,483
You liked it.
God. Did not.

715
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:07,734
Jan, have you ever
had deer?

716
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:10,028
No.
It's a delicacy.

717
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,654
And you know what?
It's an aphrodisiac.

718
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:12,822
So when we're done here,

719
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,282
you guys could go over
to the Antler Lodge,

720
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,242
sample some deer,
and talk about my raise.

721
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:17,494
What do you say, Jan?

722
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,120
Okay. Here's what
I'm going to do.

723
00:26:19,162 --> 00:26:21,122
I'm going to step outside,
collect my thoughts,

724
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:22,874
and I will return
in about 10 minutes.

725
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:23,958
Okay, you just, uh,
clear your head.

726
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,043
Thank you,
Dwight.

727
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,003
[door slams]

728
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:28,380
Look, I know it's your job,

729
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,965
I know you have to ask,
but I promise you,

730
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:32,258
I'm not going to discuss it
with him.

731
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,678
I'm certainly not
going to discuss it with you.

732
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,304
Do you have a light?

733
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:37,597
And in conclusion,

734
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:39,349
I think Lex Luthor
said it best

735
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:43,228
when he said,
"Dad, you have no idea

736
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,188
what I'm capable of."

737
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,481
That's from Superman?

738
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:47,482
Smallville.

739
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:51,695
And that is why I feel
I deserve

740
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,071
this raise.

741
00:26:54,406 --> 00:26:56,199
There's never a good time
to ask for a raise.

742
00:26:56,241 --> 00:26:57,575
You just have to go for it.

743
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,912
Maybe they were making out.

744
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,039
Yeah, that got a little out
of control.

745
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:04,290
[inhales deeply]

746
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:05,709
Jan's taking a break,
which is fine.

747
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,962
I'm doing the same.
Just chillin'.

748
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:10,755
Get my mind off of us.

749
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:13,717
She's right, I need to be more
professional at the office.

750
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:16,136
When I'm at work,
I need to focus on work.

751
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:19,389
I should call her ex-husband.

752
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:22,392
Yes, hello.
Is this R. Gould?

753
00:27:22,434 --> 00:27:24,728
Hi.
Uh, my name is Michael Scott.

754
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:26,896
I work at Dunder-Mifflin
with your wife, Jan--

755
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:29,399
ex-wife, Jan.

756
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:32,444
Yeah, that's me.
Um, I had a question.

757
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:33,570
Uh, I was wondering whether

758
00:27:33,611 --> 00:27:34,988
I could ask something
sort of personal

759
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,489
about your wife--
ex-wife?

760
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:39,868
Okay.

761
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:43,121
Or can I ask anyway?

762
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:45,415
Well, I'm just gonna ask.

763
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:46,958
When you guys were dating,

764
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,377
was she sort of easy to get
and then sort of hard to get?

765
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:53,631
Okay.

766
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,844
Yeah, that Gould
is a real interesting guy.

767
00:27:57,886 --> 00:27:59,262
What a gem.

768
00:27:59,304 --> 00:28:00,680
[inhales deeply]

769
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:03,391
I can see why he and Jan
are no longer together.

770
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,435
If--if my conversation with him

771
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:07,270
is any measure
of their relationship,

772
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:10,940
he was verbally abusive,
he was curt,

773
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:13,026
he was, uh,

774
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:16,196
he had an inability
to communicate, shall I say?

775
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:18,531
He was emotionally unavailable.

776
00:28:18,573 --> 00:28:20,241
I don't--I don't know
how she dealt with that

777
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:21,493
as long as she did.

778
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:26,456
(Pam)
Do you think Michael and Jan
actually...

779
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:27,791
I don't really want
to picture it,

780
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:29,584
but thank you, Pam.

781
00:28:29,626 --> 00:28:31,503
How do you come back
from that?

782
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:34,631
Um, you don't, I don't think,

783
00:28:34,673 --> 00:28:36,216
come all the way back,
you know.

784
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:37,717
Especially
working together.

785
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,969
No, I mean,
doing that with Michael.

786
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,137
How do you come back
from that?

787
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:42,639
Oh.
As a human being?

788
00:28:42,681 --> 00:28:45,183
Yeah, no.
I don't think you can.

789
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,228
Office romances?
Um...

790
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:50,397
[chuckles]

791
00:28:50,438 --> 00:28:52,357
I think you should probably
ask Pam.

792
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:55,777
'Cause she's in
an office romance.

793
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:56,945
Technically.

794
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:05,829
Look under the suggestion box.

795
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:14,671
I can't believe I kept this up
all day.

796
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:16,423
Signed, me.

797
00:29:18,216 --> 00:29:20,677
I'm heading back to New York.

798
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:23,346
Allan and I will conduct
your performance review

799
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:24,514
over the phone tomorrow, okay?

800
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:25,682
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

801
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:28,309
No, no. I just--I just want
to know why.

802
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,312
Michael, now is not
the time or the place.

803
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:34,190
Okay. So you're saying that
there is a different time...
No.

804
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:35,567
Or place that we can have
this discussion?

805
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:36,860
I am saying we are never
gonna have this conversation.

806
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:37,861
Well, okay.

807
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:39,863
What, never as in
never ever ever?

808
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:42,407
Or never as in
there's no chance?

809
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,701
(Jan)
Never for me
always means never ever ever.

810
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:47,245
Well, then,
Gould wasn't kidding.

811
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,205
What?
[sighs] Nothing.

812
00:29:49,247 --> 00:29:50,248
What did you say, Michael?

813
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,916
I just--[exhales deeply]
Nothing.

814
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,335
Did you call my ex?

815
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:55,754
No, I did not.

816
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:56,755
Gould? You said Gould.

817
00:29:56,796 --> 00:29:58,256
Maybe I did.

818
00:29:58,298 --> 00:29:59,299
Maybe I called him.
I don't know.

819
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:00,717
How dare you, Michael.

820
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,927
My personal life is off-limits
to you, okay?
I'm--

821
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:04,095
How dare you do that?

822
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:06,890
I didn't do that.
I--maybe he called me.

823
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,309
Why would he do that?
Why would he call you, Michael?

824
00:30:09,351 --> 00:30:11,102
Why would my husband call you?
Ex-husband.

825
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:13,646
I mean--
You have to let it go.

826
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:16,566
I just want to know
from the horse's mouth

827
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:18,860
what is the dealio.
You know, Michael...

828
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:20,653
Am I too short?
Michael, it has nothing
to do with your looks, okay?

829
00:30:20,695 --> 00:30:21,988
It's your--
it's your personality.

830
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,743
I mean, you're obnoxious
and rude and--and--and...

831
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:27,869
stupid.

832
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:30,205
And you do have coffee breath,
by the way.

833
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:33,166
And--and I don't agree
about the B.O.,

834
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,252
But you are very, very
inconsiderate.

835
00:30:36,294 --> 00:30:37,337
Really?

836
00:30:37,379 --> 00:30:39,255
Really.
You're--you're--you're...

837
00:30:39,297 --> 00:30:40,548
you're a great guy, okay?

838
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,509
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

839
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,927
You were very sweet.

840
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,429
And you stayed up with me
and talked to me

841
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:49,057
and cried with me
and I appreciate that

842
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:50,475
in this difficult time
in my life.
No, I wasn't.

843
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,227
I wasn't crying.

844
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,603
(Jan)
But I am just not
in the place right now

845
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:54,562
where I'm looking
for a relationship.

846
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:56,606
So we can still
work together,

847
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:59,109
we can still be friends,
but...

848
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:01,069
[elevator bell rings]

849
00:31:01,111 --> 00:31:03,488
Okay?

850
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:06,449
So my looks
having nothing to do with it.

851
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:07,909
[exhaling deeply]
Oh, God.

852
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,416
(Michael)
Jan is not in a place
where she feels

853
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:16,084
she can have a relationship
right now,

854
00:31:16,126 --> 00:31:19,629
and it doesn't matter
how great a guy I am.

855
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:21,589
And that is all I needed.

856
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:24,551
I'm good.
I can go home now.

857
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:32,183
[phone ringing]

858
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:39,107
Hey, it's 12:20.
Where the hell is Dwight?

859
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:41,568
Um, no idea.

860
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:43,653
Never missed a day,
my ass.

861
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,782
[phone ringing]

862
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:50,410
[chuckles softly]

863
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:52,912
[phone ringing]

864
00:31:53,747 --> 00:31:56,166
I'm here! I'm here!

865
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,003
I'm here! It's okay!

1
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:13,888
It is Friday morning,

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,724
and it is another
beautiful day

3
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,768
in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

4
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,689
Oh, oh, my God.

5
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,315
Oh!

6
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,318
[dialing telephone]

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,529
Pick up, pick up,
pick up, pick up.

8
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:34,200
Oh, we have
a serious problem here.

9
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,410
All right, everybody,
lock the doors.

10
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,620
Turn off the lights.
Pretend you're not here.

11
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,705
Are we in danger?

12
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,666
There's no time
to think about it.

13
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,043
This is real.

14
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,087
Just shh, everybody.

15
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,383
[knock at door]

16
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,844
(Kevin)
Michael, should I call the--

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,803
What?

18
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,515
The I.T. tech guy and me

19
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,852
did not get off
to a great start.

20
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:03,855
[soft piano music]

21
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:10,695
* *

22
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,682
You're going
to have to stop that.

23
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,773
I can still feel it.

24
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,573
Yeah, I tried
to install it myself,

25
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:57,283
but you guys
have these things

26
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,744
so password-protected.

27
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,788
That just means you
have to enter your password.

28
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,997
Uh...

29
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,916
What's your password,
Michael?

30
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,918
Um, it's--

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,586
Oh, 1234.

32
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,088
Yes.

33
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,007
[typing on keyboard]

34
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,387
Do you have a question
or something?

35
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,389
Mm, I don't think so.

36
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,516
About my turban maybe?

37
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,728
Nope, nope.

38
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,396
I actually wear
a turban sometimes.

39
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,315
You wanna see it?

40
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,652
I got it here.

41
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,699
Why do you have that?

42
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,452
Comedy.
It's funny.

43
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,580
It's--Johnny Carson, Carnac.

44
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:45,957
It's, um...

45
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:48,918
It is...

46
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,424
[sighs]

47
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,718
Did you have Johnny Carson
in your land?

48
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,805
In Pittsburgh?

49
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,433
Yeah, but I never
really watched him.

50
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,311
Oh.
You were forbidden.

51
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,856
No, I'm much younger than you.

52
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,524
I watch Conan.

53
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,859
All right, I'm gonna--

54
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,612
uh, I'm gonna get
a cup of coffee.

55
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,863
Do you want some coffee
or some...

56
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:17,781
No.

57
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:18,907
Tea or hummus or something?

58
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,116
No, thank you.

59
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,290
Michael--
Aah! Gah!

60
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,833
Sorry.
Please don't do that.

61
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,377
Okay, I'm sorry.
What is going on in there?

62
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,962
Why is he here?
What are you doing?

63
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,172
I can't tell you.

64
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,340
You have to tell me.

65
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,508
I don't have
to tell you anything.

66
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,218
Look, Michael.

67
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,428
I know you don't want to
have to think about this,

68
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,805
but if something were
to happen to you,

69
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,139
God forbid,

70
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,475
then I would need to know
in order to take over.

71
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,851
Dwight, nothing is
gonna happen to me. Okay?

72
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,019
I'm in the best shape
of my life.

73
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,354
Look at at this.
Grr!

74
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:50,438
Yeah, but that
doesn't matter.

75
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,690
You could get
a brain aneurysm.

76
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,691
I'm not gonna--
Or hit by a car.

77
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,401
Stop.
Or a bus or a train.

78
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,694
Or get poisoned.
Fall down a well.

79
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,195
Step on a mine.
Choke.

80
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,698
Okay, if I step on a mine
in Scranton, Pennsylvania

81
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,366
and die, you can have my job.
Okay?

82
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,284
Why don't you just go away?

83
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,661
There are certain things

84
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,038
a boss does not share
with his employees.

85
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,166
His salary.
That would depress them.

86
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:11,918
His bed.

87
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,919
It--

88
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,048
And I am not going
to tell them

89
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,092
that I'll be reading
their emails.

90
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,762
Email surveillance.

91
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,223
All the big companies
are doing it now.

92
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:28,685
It increases productivity.
It increases efficiency.

93
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,937
It is a necessary evil.

94
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,147
Well, not evil.

95
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:36,401
It's a good necessary
good thing to...do.

96
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,944
So how do you search?

97
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,904
By keyword phrase.

98
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,115
Try "profits."

99
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,284
No, try "Michael Scott."

100
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:48,121
"Michael," "boss,"
and "funny."

101
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,498
[typing on keyboard]

102
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,501
Oh, my God!
Wow!

103
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,628
[chuckles]
Email from Stanley.

104
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,423
Stanley.
Terribly nice guy.

105
00:04:58,465 --> 00:04:59,841
"Sorry I didn't
write back sooner.

106
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:00,925
"I can't go
to the game tonight

107
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,510
"because my boss
Michael is an ass

108
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,595
and making me
stay late."

109
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,972
Well, Stanley's an ass.

110
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,974
Not one of our
harder workers.

111
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,863
[clears throat]

112
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,866
Oh, this isn't good.

113
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,284
It's fine.

114
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,661
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

115
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,459
Hey, what's the deal,
Michael?

116
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,127
Why are you spying
on our computers?

117
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,671
Oh, no!

118
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,839
Everybody,
Oscar's gone crazy.

119
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,716
What other ghost stories
do you have for us?

120
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,510
That I bugged the office?

121
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,513
That I've put cameras
in the plants?

122
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,683
That I'm a robot?
[chuckles]

123
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,309
[robotic voice]
I will destroy

124
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,228
everything in my path.

125
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,479
Actually, we just--
Boop!

126
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,481
Beep! Bop!

127
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,525
Okay.
Bonk!

128
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,820
Boop, boop.
Oil can.

129
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,072
Oil can.

130
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,907
(Oscar)
Tin Man.

131
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,992
Actually we just got
a memo from I.T.

132
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,161
saying you're doing
email surveillance.

133
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,162
Oh, what?

134
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,831
No, that defeats
the whole purpose.

135
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,958
So it's true?
You have access to our emails?

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,836
Yes, yes, yes,
but it's no big deal.

137
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,170
I mean, a lot
of growing companies--

138
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,338
We're growing?

139
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,133
I thought we were worried
about downsizing.

140
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:27,846
Yes, we are not growing
in terms of people or jobs,

141
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,224
but we are growing together
as a company.

142
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:35,061
We're growing stronger,
and we're growing better

143
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,690
into a more--
into a more united company.

144
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,026
Yeah, one where
our boss spies on us.

145
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,736
I hear you, Stanley.
I do.

146
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,195
And you know what
the problem is?

147
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,405
I think I do.

148
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,115
The problem is
that when people

149
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,159
hear the term
"Big Brother,"

150
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,911
they immediately think
it's scary or bad,

151
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,621
but I don't, I think,

152
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,832
"Wow.
I love my Big Brother.

153
00:06:55,874 --> 00:07:00,754
He's handsome, and he's fit,
and he's a good guy."

154
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,924
"And he has a lot
of helpful suggestions."

155
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,635
Like, here's
a helpful suggestion for Jim.

156
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:11,389
Jim, instead of
emailing Amazon

157
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,851
to try to get that CD
that you didn't receive,

158
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,145
I suggest that you go to Visa

159
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,564
and tell 'em
to cancel the charge.

160
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,733
Yeah, definitely didn't
need help with that, but, yeah.

161
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,942
It seems like
you did though, Jim.

162
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,361
Oh.

163
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,280
Lots of emails to Amazon.
Lots of wasted computer space.

164
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,326
All right,
let's get back to work.

165
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,501
Yeah, I assumed Michael
was already doing this.

166
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:42,337
That's why I only use
my personal email account.

167
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:45,173
I wonder if I could get
that software.

168
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,260
My fiancée's been acting funny.

169
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,305
This whole email thing
could be bad for business.

170
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,974
I mean my business.

171
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:59,104
I have a side job
where I do people's taxes.

172
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,023
I gotta erase
a lot of stuff.

173
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,485
A lotof stuff.

174
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,612
Oh, hey,
just so you know,

175
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:09,197
if you have
any sensitive emails,

176
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,408
they need to be
deleted immediately.

177
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,617
I know.

178
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,035
Good.

179
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,164
[whispering]
Hey.

180
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,836
Something just happened.

181
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,171
Dwight just told Angela
that she has to delete

182
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,465
all of her sensitive
emails immediately.

183
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,926
What?
I know.

184
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,136
Hmm.

185
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,470
Do you think that
they're like--

186
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,305
No.
Right, no.

187
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,683
Ugh! Ew.

188
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,351
Ew, ew, ew.

189
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,312
Maybe.

190
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,150
It's like squishing a spider
under a book.

191
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,986
It's gonna be really gross,
but I have to look

192
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,864
and make sure
that it's really dead.

193
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,659
So if you guys
see anything...

194
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,995
Hey, Dwight?
Um...

195
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,997
My friend is kind of into

196
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,248
these two girls
that he works with.

197
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,335
Nice.
One is tall and brunette.

198
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,588
And the other one
is short and blonde

199
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:09,966
and perky
and kind of judgmental.

200
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,718
Who do you think
he should choose?

201
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,347
Does he have access
to their medical records?

202
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,224
Um...

203
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,810
I think one of
the greatest things

204
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,687
about modern America
is the computerization

205
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,314
of medical records.

206
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,066
As a volunteer sheriff,
I can look up

207
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,903
anyone's psychiatric records
or surgical histories.

208
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,696
Yeast infections.

209
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,865
There are a huge number

210
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:37,035
of yeast infections
in this county.

211
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:41,456
Probably because
we're down river

212
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,708
from that old bread factory.

213
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,878
[keyboard clacking]

214
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,819
Should've done this
a long time ago.

215
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,406
Tons of personal emails.
Huge time wasters.

216
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,116
Ugh.

217
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,159
[chuckles]
Oh.

218
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:21,121
Wow, like, Kevin rating
the best bars in Scranton.

219
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:25,458
Poor Richard's number seven.
Ugh, idiot.

220
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,960
Stupid load.

221
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,586
[phone rings]

222
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,713
Yeah.

223
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,880
(Pam)
Hey, Michael.

224
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:31,798
Accounting needs
your approval on--

225
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,717
No, I'm busy right now.

226
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:37,345
(Michael)
Meredith has an Evite

227
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,139
from Jim.

228
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,100
"Barbecue at Jim's tonight."

229
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,435
Tonight.

230
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,979
Wonder where
my "e-vitation" is?

231
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,897
Click on guest list.

232
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,859
Angela, Stanley, Oscar,

233
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,154
Meredith, Phyllis,
Kevin, Creed.

234
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,614
Must be...

235
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,616
[mouse clicking]

236
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,368
No.

237
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,550
[phone ringing]

238
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,305
This is Pam.

239
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,432
No, Pam, you have to keep
your eye on the prize.

240
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:26,353
You need to keep your eye on
the horrible, horrible prize.

241
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,646
Yahtzee.

242
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,315
(Pam)
Oh.

243
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,201
[sighs]

244
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,580
Ooh, bleh, bleh, bleh.

245
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,664
Where's your tie?

246
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,999
I don't know.

247
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,377
Just felt like taking it off.

248
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,921
Man, work can be
just so damn frustrating.

249
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,465
Don't you think, Jim?

250
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,092
Um, yeah, I guess.

251
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,302
What's going on, Michael?
Talk to me.

252
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,971
Eh, you know, same old stuff.

253
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:05,141
Same old, you know.
Boss just been riding my ass.

254
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:08,895
Oh, no, Jan?
What's going on?

255
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:10,855
(Michael)
I don't want to talk about it.

256
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:12,190
You know,
just want to hang out,

257
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,525
just be one of the guys.

258
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,068
(Dwight) The most important one
of the guys.

259
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,194
(Michael)
That's not the point.

260
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,487
Just--

261
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,114
That's exactly the point.
You've hit a slump.

262
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,365
It happens to the best of us.

263
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,449
[sighs]

264
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,160
You just have
to remember, you know,

265
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:27,163
where you come from
and who you are.

266
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,040
Okay.

267
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,084
You know, you have worked
so hard for this.

268
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,877
You are the boss.

269
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,504
You can buy and sell us

270
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:36,172
with just a snap
of your little finger.

271
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:38,550
Yes, well,
I would never do that.

272
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,635
Yeah, no one can snap
with their little finger.

273
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,804
Jim, this is hardly the time.

274
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,305
No, this is
completely the time.

275
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,057
This is the perfect time.

276
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:50,353
This is just guys
gently ribbing each other.

277
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,063
That's what it's all about.

278
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,899
Hanging out.
Enjoying friends.

279
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,484
All being the same.

280
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,486
Worker bees.

281
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,071
And their king bee.

282
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,615
(Michael) No, just bees.
Just bees hanging out.

283
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:03,616
Buzzing around.

284
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:04,909
(Dwight)
The master bee.

285
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:05,994
I am not a master bee.
(Dwight) Queen bee.

286
00:13:06,036 --> 00:13:08,204
I'm just a bee, Dwight, okay?

287
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:10,206
Just a bee.
Just buzzing.

288
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,377
Hey, Angela.
How's it going?

289
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,503
It's okay.

290
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:16,921
Listen, are you
bringing anyone

291
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,298
to Jim's party tonight?

292
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,924
No.
Are we supposed to?

293
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,259
No.

294
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:22,927
I mean, I don't know.
I don't think so.

295
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,013
Hmm.
Excuse me.

296
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,431
Oh.

297
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,236
There's always a distance

298
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,280
between a boss
and the employees.

299
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,450
It is just nature's rule.

300
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,369
It's intimidation mostly.

301
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,829
It's the awareness
that they are not me.

302
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,207
You see, they're thinking,

303
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,710
"Wow, Michael Scott.
I really respect him.

304
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,129
"What'll I do if I
drop spinach dip on him

305
00:13:58,171 --> 00:13:59,589
"at a party?
What is he gonna think of me?

306
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:01,800
"What--is it gonna
affect my salary?

307
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:04,469
Ooh, Michael Scott."

308
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,304
I don't know.
I don't know.

309
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:10,350
I do think
that I am very approachable

310
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,810
as one of the guys.

311
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,561
[laughs]

312
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:17,565
But maybe I need to be
even "approachabler."

313
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:18,942
[clears throat]

314
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,027
That's pretty, um--
Yeah.

315
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,531
Are you gonna
eat with us?

316
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,991
Of course.
Hanging with my crew.

317
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,077
Crew that I am one of.

318
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:33,456
Hanging with
my cup of noodles.

319
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,583
This is a meal in a cup
right here.

320
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,710
Hot, tasty.

321
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,004
Ah, man.
So how's your day been so far--

322
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,755
I'm sorry this is so late.
Oh.

323
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,216
There was a big order
right before yours,

324
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,968
but they threw in
a free spicy tuna roll, so--

325
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,094
You know what?
I don't need that.

326
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,637
I got my lunch.
What?

327
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,473
I got my lunch.
I'm good, I'm good.

328
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,434
You don't want this?
No.

329
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,561
You know,
why don't you keep it?

330
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,855
Tell you what, better yet,
put it in the fridge

331
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,857
and put my name on it.

332
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,359
Thanks.

333
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,946
* I got my cup of noodles *

334
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,197
Mmm.

335
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,907
Reminds me of college.

336
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:11,411
Lived on this stuff.
Brain food. Mmm.

337
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:13,788
You know what I really,
really miss about college?

338
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,207
The parties.
Everybody'd go.

339
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,753
The athletes, the nerds,
professors.

340
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:22,005
The professors
would go to the parties?

341
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:25,050
Yeah.
They were the most fun.

342
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,385
We always invited them.

343
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,430
(Jim)
It's true.

344
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:31,723
I'm having a party.

345
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:34,726
I've got three cases
of imported beer,

346
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,311
karaoke machine,

347
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,563
and I didn't invite Michael.

348
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:41,399
So three ingredients
for a great party.

349
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,734
And it's nothing personal.

350
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,319
I just think that
if he were there,

351
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,445
people wouldn't be able
to relax,

352
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:47,197
you know, have fun.

353
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,449
And my roommate
wants to meet everybody

354
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:51,743
because I'm pretty sure
he thinks I'm making Dwight up.

355
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,830
He is very real.

356
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,165
Hi.
Hey, babe, hey.

357
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,458
Hey.
How are you?

358
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,918
Good.
You look good.

359
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,252
Thank you.

360
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,588
Hey, um, I was wondering
if it might be okay

361
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,590
if I go to Lonny's
poker game tonight.

362
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,550
I promise it'll be, like,
the last time for a while.

363
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:10,095
We're supposed to go
to the barbecue at Jim's house.

364
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,930
Oh, man.

365
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,641
Um, could you go without me?

366
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:17,143
Make something up?
Say I ate something or--

367
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:19,104
[sighs]

368
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,522
Huh?
Huh?

369
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:22,649
You're the best.
You're the best.

370
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:23,483
I might be late.

371
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:24,776
Okay, don't wake me up

372
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:25,860
'cause I'm playing ball
in the morning.

373
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,279
Okay.
All right, bye.

374
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,411
Did I miss anything?

375
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,789
Hey, Jim.
What's up, Kev?

376
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,125
Hey, um, I know
it's kind of last minute,

377
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,293
but I was wondering
if it would be cool

378
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,129
if I brought
my fiancée tonight.

379
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,338
Oh, yeah, totally.

380
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,007
It's totally casual,
so not really worried

381
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:48,174
about numbers or whatever.

382
00:16:48,216 --> 00:16:49,217
Cool.
All right?

383
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,510
Thanks.
Yeah, definitely.

384
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:56,683
What?

385
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,981
Oh.
Yes!

386
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:05,191
Thank you.

387
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,782
Question.

388
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:13,867
On the Internet,

389
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,035
there are several
different options

390
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,286
to get to your house
for the party tonight.

391
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:17,746
-Oh, uh, no, no.
-And I was wondering--

392
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,539
No, no, no.
Keep that down.

393
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,332
Why?

394
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,543
Because not everybody
knows about the party.

395
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,588
Like who?
Who doesn't know?

396
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:29,924
Um, Michael.

397
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,634
Why just Michael?

398
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,889
Because it's a surprise.

399
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,182
Is it?
Mm-hmm.

400
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,892
Oh, that's perfect.

401
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:39,934
So don't tell.

402
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:40,894
I won't.
Okay.

403
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,522
So Dwight thinks
that tonight

404
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,274
is a surprise party
for Michael.

405
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:48,276
Really? That's great.
I know.

406
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,028
Maybe we can get him to hide
and wait somewhere.

407
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,988
[chuckles]

408
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,282
Oh, man.
Oh, you know what?

409
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:55,408
Speaking of which,
I was just trying

410
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,701
to get a handle on,
you know,

411
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,578
numbers and--
for food and stuff,

412
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,372
so do you think
Roy's gonna come or--

413
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,040
Oh, no.
He can't make it.

414
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,917
Oh, okay.
Cool.

415
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,463
Hey there.
Hey.

416
00:18:08,505 --> 00:18:10,507
Almost quitting time.

417
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:13,301
Yep.
It's 4:00.

418
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,178
One more hour

419
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,972
to take care of anything
you forgot to do.

420
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,476
[clears throat]
Hey, you know,

421
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,687
I don't know if you have
any plans tonight,

422
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,772
but if you don't,
we could hang out.

423
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:32,237
Oh, um...I can't.

424
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,571
You have plans?
Mm-hmm, yeah, I do.

425
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,490
Yeah, I do too,
I do too.
Oh, you do?

426
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,075
Big plans.
I do, yeah.

427
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,368
Because you just said that
you wanted to hang out--

428
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,869
Tonight,
I can't do it tonight.

429
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,414
No. Improv class.
I have improv class.

430
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,748
Hanging out with
my improv buds.
Really?

431
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,667
Yeah.
Oh, that sounds
like a lot of fun.

432
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,335
Oh, it's the best.
It is the best.

433
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,087
I would not miss it
for the world,

434
00:18:49,129 --> 00:18:52,298
but if something else came up,
I would definitely not go.

435
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:57,053
Improv sounds great.

436
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,722
It is.

437
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,102
Okay.

438
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,937
All right.

439
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,105
[Stanley coughs]

440
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:08,481
What?

441
00:19:08,523 --> 00:19:10,608
I think Stanley
just coughed.

442
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,613
5:00.

443
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:19,075
Time to go get my improv on.

444
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:20,952
Little bit of the comedy juice.

445
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,915
Mmm, all right, see if you
can guess what this is.

446
00:19:30,253 --> 00:19:33,381
[growling]

447
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:42,390
That is a dinosaur
getting ready

448
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,476
to go to improv class.

449
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,895
Just a taste of the improv.

450
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,443
Hey, Pam, do you need me

451
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:54,819
to walk you
to your vehicular transport?

452
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:55,820
No, thanks.

453
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:56,946
All right.

454
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:58,198
Oscar, do you have
big plans tonight--

455
00:19:58,239 --> 00:19:59,699
I'm on a call.
Okay.

456
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,327
Kevin, big man, big man,
what are you doing tonight?

457
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,328
Where you off to?

458
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,704
My brother is in town,

459
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:07,374
and we are going to see
the Alaska Film Festival at--

460
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:08,875
Okay, all right.
Oh.

461
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,378
Hey, Angela.
Rushy, rushy.

462
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,754
Where you rushing off to?

463
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:14,339
I'm just leaving
for the day.

464
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,007
Yeah, well, duh.
Where you headed?

465
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,259
Charity.
Bake Drive.

466
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,344
Liar!

467
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,261
No!
You are a liar.

468
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:22,055
No, I'm not!

469
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:23,848
[sighs]
Dwight.

470
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,309
Oh, Dwight,
my loyal compadre.

471
00:20:26,351 --> 00:20:28,436
You and I
are hanging tonight.

472
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,772
The two of us.
We are celebrating

473
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,316
our freedom
and our manhood.

474
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,776
You know what?

475
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:36,319
Why don't we watch that show
you've been wanting to watch?

476
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,530
That stupid Battleship Galaxy--

477
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,864
Battlestar Galactica?

478
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,991
That's--whatever stupid show
you want to watch.

479
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:44,703
I can't tonight.
Unfortunately, I've got plans.

480
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,081
I have to go to practice.
Soccer practice.

481
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,792
I didn't know you played
soccer, Dwight.

482
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:52,335
Clarinet.

483
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:54,045
You too, Dwight?

484
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,380
Have fun tonight.

485
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,631
Whatever it is
that you're doing.

486
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,759
And I'll see you Monday.

487
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:03,930
[whispering]
He has no idea.

488
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,771
[soft rock music]

489
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,106
Quick announcement,
everybody.

490
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,232
If I could have
everybody's attention.

491
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:15,942
We do have wine
in the kitchen,

492
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,278
and there is beer
available on the porch,

493
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,696
and despite
what you might think,

494
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:21,114
it's not all
for Meredith and Kelly,

495
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:22,323
so please enjoy.

496
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:24,951
Jim, you really think
this is a good idea?

497
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:27,495
Huh?
A hide-a-key rock?

498
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,913
Hey, you must be Dwight.

499
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,040
You don't work with us.

500
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:31,416
That's because
Mark's my roommate.

501
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,667
Oh.
So...

502
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,127
Hey, I love
the Birkenstocks.

503
00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:35,378
Thanks.

504
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,297
Yeah, I always keep
an extra set in the car

505
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,632
for special occasions.

506
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,593
Jim, come here.
Mm-hmm?

507
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,136
When is the guest
of honor coming?

508
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:45,930
Oh.
Uh, later-ish.

509
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,432
He's gonna love it!

510
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:49,059
Great.

511
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,435
I just wanted
to let you guys know

512
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:52,312
that we will be taking
the tour like I promised--

513
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:53,521
Hey.
Hey!

514
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:54,814
Just in time.

515
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,149
Do you want to go
on a group tour?

516
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:57,275
-We were just about to leave.
-Definitely.

517
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,361
Well, the group tour
is now leaving then.

518
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,404
Ladies and gentlemen,
just a few things

519
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:02,864
that we're gonna be
pointing out to you today.

520
00:22:02,906 --> 00:22:04,908
You will be able
to see both bedrooms,

521
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,493
and if we're lucky,

522
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:07,744
maybe get a chance
to peek into the bathroom.

523
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:08,787
Who knows?

524
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,121
I have to remind you also

525
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:11,915
that flash photography
is prohibited.

526
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,166
And as much as you can,

527
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:15,001
please refrain
from touching things.

528
00:22:15,043 --> 00:22:16,628
I know you might want to.

529
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,962
Hey, is Katie coming?

530
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,673
Um, actually I haven't
talked to her in a while.

531
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:21,007
Huh?
Oh.

532
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,258
Is it cool if I call her?

533
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,219
(Jim) We can talk
about that later.

534
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,389
Watch me enter my comfort zone.

535
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,183
Ah, they can't even start
without me.

536
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:31,976
Hello!

537
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:33,186
Okay, let's get
right into it.

538
00:22:33,228 --> 00:22:34,521
I need two people
for the first scene.

539
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:36,856
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Mr. Kotter!

540
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,692
Mr. Kotter!

541
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:39,734
Okay.
Michael.

542
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:40,902
And...

543
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,030
Anybody?

544
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:45,532
How about Marybeth?

545
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:47,867
Okay.
Come on.

546
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:49,536
Okay, so you start
us off, Marybeth.

547
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:50,495
All right, great.

548
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:56,251
* La la la la la *

549
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,585
Boom!
Detective Michael Scarn!

550
00:22:57,627 --> 00:22:58,837
I'm with the FBI!

551
00:22:58,878 --> 00:22:59,879
Think about this.

552
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:01,798
What is the most exciting thing

553
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,967
that can happen on TV
or in movies

554
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:07,053
or in real life?
Somebody has a gun.

555
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,347
That's why I always start
with a gun

556
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:12,392
because you can't top it.
You just can't.

557
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,561
Okay, Bill,
why don't you start us off?

558
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:15,854
And I want you guys to jump in

559
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,522
when you have an idea,
all right?

560
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,732
Okay, so let's start him up.

561
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:21,359
[applause]

562
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:26,448
Thirsty.
So incredibly thirsty.

563
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,367
Welcome to
the Sahara Desert Latte Hut.

564
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,036
Would you like to try
a green iced tea blended?

565
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,537
[students chuckle]

566
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,414
Just water.

567
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:37,375
Uh, I'm supposed to meet
my doctor here.

568
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,170
Have you seen him?
He's a very angry midget.

569
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,296
Boom! Freeze!

570
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,715
Michael Scoon, FBI!
You know what you did.

571
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:46,634
Boom, boom, boom!

572
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:48,094
Yeah, you thought
you could get away

573
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,722
with your little ruse
didn't you? Didn't you?

574
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:51,890
Well, you didn't.

575
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:53,933
Because I know where
you hid the diamonds.

576
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:55,060
I've been onto you

577
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,478
and your little friends
for weeks.

578
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,772
Boom, boom, boom!

579
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,148
I'm not even in the scene!

580
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,232
-Boom, boom, boom!
-Stop, okay, stop.

581
00:24:01,274 --> 00:24:02,609
Stop!
They're not--stop!

582
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,777
-Boom!
-Okay, you shot me.

583
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,111
-Great. Stop.
-What?

584
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:07,155
Okay, you can't just shoot
everyone in the scene.

585
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:08,531
Well, if you hadn't
stopped the scene,

586
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:09,991
you would've seen
where it was going.

587
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,284
Okay, what about
the scene they set up?

588
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:12,702
Boring.

589
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,204
No, it wasn't.
No more guns.

590
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:15,580
-Could've--
- No, no.

591
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:18,500
Michael, I want you to give me
all the guns you have.

592
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:22,545
Just get rid of all your guns
and give them to me.

593
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:24,798
Great.
Bleh!

594
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:25,965
Bleh.
Okay.

595
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:29,844
So if you just step
into this room,

596
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,471
uh, yeah, look around.

597
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:34,140
You might find a few clues
about who lives here.

598
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:37,727
He likes biking, obviously,
and what else?

599
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:40,980
Uh, he likes tour guides,
I guess,

600
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:43,274
and if you're very perceptive,

601
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:45,068
you'll notice
that he didn't do

602
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,737
a great job cleaning his room.

603
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:50,323
Okay, and that's the to--

604
00:24:50,365 --> 00:24:52,325
And he's really into penguins
or something?

605
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:55,036
Um, thank you, Ryan.
Uh, no, I don't know.

606
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:56,329
I think I made
the mistake one day

607
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:57,622
of telling someone
I liked penguins,

608
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,332
and here we are.

609
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:02,293
I'm sorry.
I gave you that penguin.

610
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,170
And that's why
it's on my desk, Phyllis.

611
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:06,423
It means a lot to me, and now
that I know it's from you,

612
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:07,757
it means even more.

613
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:09,551
Moving on.

614
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:12,220
Okay, for the next exercise,
let's everyone pair up.

615
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:14,222
[claps]

616
00:25:15,807 --> 00:25:18,768
(improv teacher)
Partner and...

617
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,228
everybody got somebody?

618
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,647
-Uh-huh.
-Okay, good.

619
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:24,691
Um, okay.

620
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:27,027
Nobody ever wants to fight
the heavyweight champ.

621
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:29,320
Nobody wants that title shot.

622
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,531
I'll just throw in
some suggestions.

623
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,658
(improv teacher)
Okay, you guys want to start?

624
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,035
Don't throw in any suggestions.

625
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:36,119
-They're in a whorehouse...
-Okay.

626
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,078
We don't need
a suggestion for this one.

627
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,204
-And he's a proctologist.
-Okay.

628
00:25:38,246 --> 00:25:39,330
This one's gonna
come from them.

629
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,874
This one's gonna
come from them.

630
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,208
A game called Yes, And.

631
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,128
And you will say
the first sentence.

632
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:47,547
You're telling a story--

633
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:49,382
First sentence is,
"I am a proctologist."

634
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:50,800
We're not gonna get
a suggestion on this one.

635
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:52,302
It's gonna come
from them, okay?

636
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:59,100
Jim's bedroom.

637
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:05,148
See, I knew we lost
somebody on the tour.

638
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:08,026
Cool.
This is your desk.

639
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,069
This is my desk.

640
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,612
Your home office.

641
00:26:10,653 --> 00:26:13,281
Home office.
This is it.
Yeah.

642
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:15,200
You have to sit down
so I can get the full effect.

643
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:17,619
Okay, sure.
Will do.

644
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,998
Okay, wait.
So that would make me...

645
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:25,001
Like right here.

646
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:27,837
Yeah, yep,
that feels about right.

647
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,172
And then Dwight
would be like--

648
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:30,382
Um, you know what?

649
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:31,758
Let's just leave
that image out of it

650
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,218
because this is a happy place.

651
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,012
Happy thoughts, Pam.
Happy thoughts.

652
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,723
Um...
[gasps]

653
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:39,849
Yearbook.

654
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:41,059
Yeah, you don't
have to, um--

655
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:42,435
All right.

656
00:26:42,477 --> 00:26:44,229
Yes, that's not gonna
be awkward at all.

657
00:26:46,398 --> 00:26:49,526
[laughs]
Oh, no!
Oh, yeah.

658
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:52,779
You were so dorky!
Thank you.

659
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:54,155
[laughs]

660
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:02,330
(improv teacher)
Freeze.
I'm in.

661
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:03,540
Do you want to go over
the rules one more time?

662
00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:05,041
No, no, no, no.

663
00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:09,337
I'm looking
in my wallet for money

664
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,715
so you can tell me
my fortune.

665
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:16,136
I promise it's worth it.

666
00:27:16,177 --> 00:27:18,430
Ooh, I can see you
walking out of here,

667
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,473
and you're thrilled
with your reading.

668
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:22,142
[class chuckles]

669
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,185
What are you--

670
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:29,357
[whispering]

671
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:32,819
Michael,
what did you tell him?

672
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:34,154
Nothing.

673
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:36,656
Then why are his hands up?
Bill?

674
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:38,950
He told me he couldn't
show it to me,

675
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:40,452
but he has a gun.

676
00:27:42,203 --> 00:27:43,413
Okay.
Let's call it a day.

677
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:44,289
Nice job.

678
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,249
Good.
That was good.

679
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:48,376
Good work, everybody.

680
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:51,629
Improv's hit or miss.
Last week I was on fire.

681
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:56,343
Just Robin Williams, Ali G,
Ryan Stiles, nailing it.

682
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:59,387
Home runs every--
every swing of the bat.

683
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:03,266
Um, this week, I was paired up
with some pretty lame people,

684
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:05,310
so you have to deal with that.

685
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:06,603
"Whose Line Is It Anyway?"

686
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,271
It's Michael Scott's line
'cause, generally,

687
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,357
Michael Scott's
is the funniest line.

688
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:12,525
Hey, I love that playhouse.

689
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,486
Oh, yeah, thanks,
belongs to the owners.

690
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:17,280
Mm, I'd love
to get one like that.

691
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:19,741
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

692
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:21,201
Interesting.

693
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,163
Totally forgot you had a kid.
Sorry about that.

694
00:28:25,205 --> 00:28:26,831
Interesting.

695
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:28,875
Angela.

696
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:31,211
Burger, dog?
Having fun?

697
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:33,880
I got sap on me.

698
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:36,633
Chicken, hot dog, burger?

699
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,551
I'm a vegetarian.

700
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,846
-There's soda inside.
-Ugh.

701
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:43,973
I didn't think the premium
laser color copy batch

702
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:45,392
would sell as well as it did.

703
00:28:45,433 --> 00:28:47,227
It surprised us all.
I'll tell you why.

704
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:48,687
-Because--
-I'm sorry, guys.

705
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,480
Can we please
not talk about paper?

706
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:52,482
There's gotta be something else

Hey, Phyllis.

713
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:12,085
Come here for a second.
Sure.

714
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,294
Have you heard anything

715
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:16,881
about any secret
office romances or--

716
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,425
You tell me.

717
00:29:19,634 --> 00:29:22,220
Well, you do mean
you and Jim, right?

718
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,306
Oh, God.
I am so sorry.

719
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:26,933
I mean, I thought--

720
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:28,268
you guys hang out
all the time,

721
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:29,769
and you're talking
all the time, and I--

722
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:31,604
I'm sorry.
It's like--

723
00:29:31,646 --> 00:29:34,315
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay.

724

Ah!

726
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:42,657
Not so fast, fire guy.

727
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:47,620
Think we need
some more heat, fire guy?

728
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:52,083
Hey, fire guy, maybe we should
burn Jim's house down.

729
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:53,585
That's really funny.

730
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:57,255
Hey, Kelly,
I called him fire guy.

731
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:59,174
Good one, Kev.

732
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,592
Yeah.

733
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:04,137
Hey, Stanley--

734
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:05,472
He called me fire guy.

735
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:08,350
Oh, good one.

We're all gonna carpool.

We're all going to Bernie's?

741
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:23,865
Oh, uh, sorry.
We're not going as a group.

742
00:30:23,907 --> 00:30:25,325
It's just a private friend

743
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,785

all of us from different ways

birthday thing.

well, guys, I'd love to go

746

to Bernie's with you,
but you know what?

747
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:32,624
I have an office party.

748
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:33,917
Big office party
I need to go to.

749
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,335
-Okay, see you next week.
-Can't get out of it.

Good job.
Hey, see you later.

Oh, hey, how's your
new side project going?

756
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:52,977
Um, oh, yeah.
I gave that up.

757
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:55,230
Really?
Yeah, it turns out
I was, um,

758
00:30:55,271 --> 00:30:57,524
just grasping at straws.

759
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:59,567
Just because two people
are hanging out,

760
00:30:59,609 --> 00:31:01,820
it doesn't mean
that they're together.

761
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:04,698
You know? Like, people
can just be friends.

762
00:31:04,739 --> 00:31:06,741
And I think that it was
really unfair of us

763
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:08,910
to assume that there was
anything else going on.

764
00:31:11,246 --> 00:31:13,498
* Just turn around now *

Everybody.

00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,012
Wow, who opened the morgue
for this thing?

770
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,805
I was just driving by.
Thought I'd drop in.

771
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:29,973
There's some wine.

772
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:31,766
I would love a glass
if you're gonna open it.

He is a good guy,
not a terrorist.

the story about me
getting into improv was

817
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,801
that I was walking
down the street,

818
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:31,511
and a race car pulls up,

819
00:33:31,553 --> 00:33:33,471
and the guy says,
"Hey, you're funny.

"You're the funniest guy
I've ever seen.

is not Dale Earnhardt."

that I found a flyer.

00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,364
Is this an overnight?

60
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,952
Maybe. The suspense is just
so exciting, isn't it?

61
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,871
Should my wife tell her boss
she's not coming in tomorrow?

62
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,790
Maybe, I don't know.
Not maybe. Yes or no.

63
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,127
Well, no, but...okay,
don't spoil it for everybody.

64
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,879
All right?
But we...

65
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,674
[inhales deeply]
Are going on a booze cruise

66
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,219
on Lake Wallenpaupack.

67
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,014
In January?

68
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,474
It's cheaper.

69
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,933
This is not just
another party.

70
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:07,604
This is a leadership
training exercise.

71
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,022
Right?

72
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,816
I'm going to combine elements
of fun and motivation

73
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:16,154
and education into a single,
mind-blowing experience.

74
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,822
So this is--

75
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,408
[door slams]

76
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,494
Well, we're not going
to Florida.

77
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,455
Oh.
Someplace with a pool, then?

78
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,922
[Jan knocks on door]
Yeah.

79
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,382
Hello, Michael.
(Michael)
Hello.

80
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,175
(Jan)
Can we come in?
Of course. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

81
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,511
Thank you very much.

82
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,639
[sighs]
Oh. Every man's dream.

83
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,933
Oh, really?
A surprise visit from his boss?

84
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,727
Two ladies at once.

85
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,229
What?

86
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,189
(Michael)
Why are you looking
at me like that?

87
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,651
Okay, you heard something.

88
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,695
Um, yeah.
It's a booze cruise,

89
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:59,906
but it's--there's more
to the story than that.

90
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,032
A booze cruise?

91
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,450
What do you mean?

92
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,619
Leadership off-site.

93
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,706
Uh, booze cruise
is just a rhyme.

94
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,749
And Michael, we discussed
the IRS's regulations.

95
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,501
Yeah, I got--I don't even know
why I said booze cruise.

96
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,587
This event has to have
legitimate business content

97
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,214
to be tax-deductible.
We discussed that.

98
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,716
(Michael)
Of--of course, of course,
of course.

99
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,593
Yes, yes. Look, I have
a whole program planned.

100
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,973
Jan, this program is going
to change people's lives.

101
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,225
I am going to be dropping
serious knowledge

102
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,560
all over the boat.

103
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,936
Good.

104
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,187
This is Brenda Matlowe
from corporate training.

105
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:32,397
Hello.

106
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,481
I thought that she could
attend tonight

107
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,941
and if your event
is appropriate,

108
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,067
you could give it
to other branches.

109
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,194
Oh, cool, cool.

110
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,572
And maybe you could attend
tonight

111
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,906
and then you could stay over
at my house...

112
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,325
[sighs]
(Michael)
For the night.

113
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,077
Awkward.

114
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,579
That's--you know what, Brenda?

115
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,205
Could Jan and I have a moment
alone?

116
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:53,126
Jan said if you asked me that,
I was supposed to say no.

117
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,879
Really?
You seriously said that?

118
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,758
[sighing]
Okay, Brenda.

119
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,551
Could Jan and I have
a moment alone?

120
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,969
Sure.
Brenda.

121
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,013
(Michael)
Thanks.
I mean no.

122
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,351
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna go now.

123
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,977
And, um--[clears throat]

124
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,897
Okay.
See you later.

125
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,273
Okay.
See you later.

126
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,234
And, um, try to be
professional.
I'll call you later.

127
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,527
(Jan)
That's all right.
You call me--

128
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:20,904
youcall me if
you need anything, right?

129
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:21,905
Uh-huh.
(Michael)
I'll call you, too.

130
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,783
So...

131
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,576
you're probably gonna get
carded.

132
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:29,037
So, um, I can make you
a fake ID.

133
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,997
We have a laminating machine.

134
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,085
It is now time to unveil

135
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,754
the destination
of this year's retreat.

136
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:42,300
We are going
on a harbor cruise

137
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,677
of Lake Wallenpaupack.

138
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,014
[Oscar clears throat]

139
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,308
It's a booze cruise.

140
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,436
All right.

141
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,480
I have a test for business
school tomorrow night.

142
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:58,441
Is it okay if skip the cruise
and study for that?

143
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,318
No, this is mandatory.

144
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,821
But don't worry, you know what?
You're going to learn plenty.

145
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,366
This is going to turn
your life around, Ryan.

146
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:07,826
I'm already in business school.
(Michael)
Well--

147
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,202
(Kelly)
Wait, Michael?

148
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:10,495
(Michael)
Yeah?

149
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,580
Um, why did you tell us
to bring a bathing suit?

150
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,957
To throw you off the scent.

151
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,709
Yeah, but I bought
a bathing suit.

152
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,044
Well, just keep the tags on
and you can return it.

153
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,921
I took the tags off already.

154
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,256
Well, that's not
my fault, okay?

155
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,008
Just--we're not going
to pay for a bathing suit.

156
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,385
Okay. I know what
you're all thinking.

157
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,470
Who is this smart,
little cookie?

158
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,055
Her name is Brenda...

159
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,391
something, and she
is from corporate.

160
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,561
And she is here, like you, to
learn from what I have to say.

161
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,146
I am a great
motivational speaker.

162
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:40,191
I attended a Tony Robbins event
by the airport last year,

163
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,110
and...

164
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,236
it wasn't the actual course.

165
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,739
You have to pay
for the actual course.

166
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,035
But, it talkedabout
the actual course.

167
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,037
And I've incorporated

168
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,749
a lot of his ideas
into my own course.

169
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,292
Leader...

170
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,002
ship.

171
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:04,215
The word ship is hidden inside
the word leadership

172
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,426
as its derivation.

173
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:11,222
So, if this office
is in fact a ship,

174
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,892
as its leader...

175
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,226
I am the captain.

176
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,644
But...

177
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:20,065
We're all in the same boat.
Teamwork.

178
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:24,277
Last year, Michael's theme was
"bowl over the competition."

179
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,530
So guess where we went?

180
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:31,659
Now, on this ship
that is the office,

181
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,788
what is the sales department?

182
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,499
Anyone?
Oscar, what do you think?

183
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:40,126
I don't--I don't know what
the categories are

184
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,336
of workers on a boat.

185
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,296
I'm not giving you the answer.

186
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:44,798
Deck hands is one.

187
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,092
Oh, oh.
Can I be the first mate?

188
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,927
No. I'm first mate.
You're second mate.

189
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,929
I'm first mate as the captain.

190
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:53,556
How about the sales department
is the sails?

191
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,766
Yes, Daryl.

192
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:57,560
The sales department
makes sales. Good.

193
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,645
Let me just explain.

194
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,689
I see the sales department

195
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,774
as the furnace.

196
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,651
A furnace?
Yeah.

197
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:05,652
Yeesh, how old
is this ship?

198
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,028
How about the anchor?

199
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,030
Well, the anchor
is the only thing

200
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:12,325
that kind of slows
the ship down.

201
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,035
Toby's the anchor.

202
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,120
Oh, God.

203
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,330
He--I'll tell you
about Toby later.

204
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,498
He's awful.

205
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,333
Yeah, I know Toby
from Jan's birthday.

206
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,376
Hey, Brenda.
Hey.

207
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:22,585
Okay, Toby.
So--

208
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,170
What does the furnace do?

209
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,630
All right, let's not get
hung up on the furnace.

210
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,257
This just--
[sighs]

211
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,591
It's the sales--

212
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,592
I see the sales department
are down there.

213
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,011
They're in the engine room

214
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,555
and they are shoveling
coal into the furnace, right?

215
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,056
I mean who saw
the movie Titanic?

216
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,975
They were very important
in the movie Titanic.

217
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,852
Who saw it?
Show of hands.

218
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,603
Not really sure what movie
you're talking about.

219
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:41,521
You sure you got
the title right?

220
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,897
Titanic.

221
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,150
I think you're thinking of
The Hunt for Red October.

222
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,819
No, I'm--
Leo DiCaprio, come on!

223
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:49,404
Michael stands in
the front of the boat

224
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,532
and says that he's king of the
world within the first hour,

225
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,743
or I give you
my next paycheck.

226
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,953
Michael, everyone in
the engine room drowned.

227
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:00,165
No--thank you.
Spoiler alert.

228
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,459
You saw the movie,
those of you who did.

229
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,710
[stutters]

230
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,129
They're happy down there
in the furnace room.

231
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:09,007
And they're dirty and grimy
and sweaty.

232
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,843
And they're singing
their ethnic songs.

233
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,055
And--actually,
that might be warehouse.

234
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,598
What?

235
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,516
The--no--

236
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,268
No, I didn't--

237
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,728
Okay, well, the--

238
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,898
Okay, in a nutshell what I'm
saying is leadership.

239
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:28,234
We'll get--we'll talk more
about that on the boat--ship.

240
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,694
Aye, aye, Captain.

241
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,780
(Michael)
* A three-hour tour *

242
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,865
* A three-hour tour *

243
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,992
Pam, you are Mary Ann!

244
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:36,993
We have...

245
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:38,370
The Professor and Ginger.

246
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,871
Welcome aboard.

247
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,623
Angela, you are Mrs. Howell.

248
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,083
Lovey.

249
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,250
Uh, the native.

250
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,377
Sometimes they come
from neighboring--

251
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,420
Oh, uh, we have, uh...

252
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,506
one of the Globetrotters.

253
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,548
I am the Skipper.

254
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,550
And Dwight,
you will be Gilligan.

255
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,927
Cool!

256
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,053
Actually, I'm the Skipper.

257
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,137
Okay.
But you could
be Gilligan.

258
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:56,971
Oh, I'd rather die.

259
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,765
Hi.
I am Michael Scott.

260
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,725
I am the Captain
of this party.

261
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,726
I'm Captain Jack.

262
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:03,311
I'm captain of the ship.
Ahh!

263
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:05,146
I'm also captain of anyone
who sets foot on the ship.

264
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,232
Hi, welcome aboard.

265
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,441
Okay.

266
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,485
In an office,
when you are ranking people,

267
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,697
manager is higher than captain.

268
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,407
On a boat, who knows?

269
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,243
It's nebul-ose.

270
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,369
Hey, look.

271
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,372
I'm king of the world!

272
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,666
[Dwight laughing]
(Michael)
Woo!

273
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,126
[Jim mouths words]
(Dwight)
Woo!

274
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,753
(Michael)
Hey!

275
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,547
What's wrong with you?
You missed the boat.

276
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,673
I got lost!

277
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:32,757
Idiot.

278
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,134
We can go back.
No, no, no!

279
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,679
That's his punishment
for not being here on time.

280
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,056
Too bad, anchor!

281
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,228
I guess I shouldn't have
stopped for dinner.

282
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,940
(Michael and Dwight)
Woo!

283
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,446
(Captain Jack)
Okay, all right.

284
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,447
Welcome aboard.

285
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,782
I am your captain,
Captain Jack.

286
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,493
And I am the Regional Manager
of Dunder Mifflin,

287
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,162
Michael Scott.

288
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,164
(Michael)
Welcome, welcome.

289
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,248
Okay, so, um--
Okay, so.

290
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,417
Please.
The, uh, life preservers.

291
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,960
(Michael)
Right.

292
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,628
They are located underneath the
seats all along the perimeter

293
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,088
But don't worry.
of the boat.

294
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,381
You are not going to be needing
life preservers tonight.

295
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:14,507
Well, we might be, okay?
This is just gonna be--

296
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,967
Please let me finish, okay?
Well--

297
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,218
Thank you.

298
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,511
So the Coast Guard requires

299
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,889
that I tell you where
the safety exits are.

300
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,015
Now, on this ship,
it's very easy.

301
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,683
Anywhere over the side.

302
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,935
[Dwight laughs]

303
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,020
Not only am I
your ship's captain,

304
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,480
I am also
your party captain!

305
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,898
Woo! We're going
to get it going here

306
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,024
in just a few minutes--

307
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,484
And I am your
party captain too!

308
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,361
And you are going to put
on your dancing shoes

309
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,862
later on.
Hey, Mike, Mike.

310
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,322
So, we are gonna--

311
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,657
Uh, if you don't mind.
Rock it! what?

312
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,659
(Captain Jack)
Please, okay?

313
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,579
If the boat's a-rocking,
don't come knocking.

314
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,580
Michael!
Yup.

315
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:46,998
Uh, your company employees

316
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,541
are not the only people
on the boat tonight, okay?

317
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,751
We're all gonna have
a good time tonight.

318
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,920
Hey, hey,
listen, Mike.

319
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,713
Why don't you let me
and my crew do our job?

320
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:54,923
You just sit back--
Mm-hmm.

321
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,758
And have
a good time, okay?
Okay, yup.

322
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,218
All right?
All right.

323
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,804
On the high seas,
Captain Jack is the leader.

324
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,263
On the land, it's Michael.

325
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,975
On the ramp up to the boat,
I was a bit conflicted.

326
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,560
But now that I'm here?
[inhales deeply]

327
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:10,939
I'll follow this captain
to hell and back.

328
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,650
Hey, Captain Jack. What kinda
fish they got in this lake?

329
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,193
Perch, bass.

330
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,611
You know, my grandfather told
me there was a monster here

331
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,613
that eat Catholics.
Have you heard?

332
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:19,739
I hadn't heard that, Dwight.

333
00:12:19,781 --> 00:12:21,783
If the hull is breached
for any reason

334
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,785
or the boat is overtaken,

335
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,161
I am a volunteer
sheriff's deputy

336
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,122
and you can count on me.

337
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,415
(Captain Jack)
That's good to know, Dwight.
Thanks.

338
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,792
Your problem now,
Captain Jack.

339
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:31,876
You guys,

340
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,253
it's like we're
in high school

341
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,295
and we're at
the cool table.

342
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,047
[laughing]
Right?

343
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,215
Yeah.

344
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,758
Pam, were you a cheerleader?

345
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,137
No, she was total little Miss
Artsy Fartsy in high school.

346
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,180
She wore the turtleneck
and everything.

347
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:46,224
That's hilarious.
[laughing]

348
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,517
It's not hilarious,
but--

349
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,768
Where'd you
go to school?

350
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,103
Bishop O'Hara.

351
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,938
"Piss la poo
cares-uh"?

352
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,940
We played you.

353
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,151
You--you really
look familiar.

354
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,361
Did you, uh--You cheered
for them, didn't you?

355
00:12:58,403 --> 00:13:00,321
Mm, no.

356
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,115
Yes, I did.

357
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:04,034
* A-W-E *

358
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,744
* S-O-M-E *

359
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,328
* Awesome, awesome
is what we are *

360
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,330
* we're the football
superstars *

361
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:11,374
* A-W-E *
I remember that!

362
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:13,835
* S-O-M-E *
We crushed you, like, 42-10.

363
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,253
Having fun?
Yeah.

364
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,048
Everybody's really nice.

365
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,718
Good, well, that is what
Scranton is all about.

366
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,387
Not like you "New Yawkers."

367
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,432
I just moved there.
Yeah, I hear ya, I hear ya.

368
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:30,810
You know Jan and I were
intimate, right?

369
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,896
She ever mention me and the
fact that were intimate?

370
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,065
No.

371
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,150
Good.
That's professional.

372
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,526
Respecting privacy.

373
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:39,819
When are you going
to start the, uh--

374
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,321
What?
The, uh, presentation?

375
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:43,198
Well, I already sort of
started it back at the office

376
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,200
and on the dock with
the Gilligan thing.

377
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,619
So, right now,
I was thinking.

378
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,661
Yes.

379
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,662
Okay!

380
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:50,997
Listen up,

381
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,624
all you, Dunder Mifflinites!

382
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,877
I would like to talk to you
all about

383
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:57,504
life preservers.

384
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,340
Now, one important
life preserver

385
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,509
in business is IT Support.

386
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,345
[chuckles] Not now Mike,
we're doing the limbo!

387
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,347
[laughing]
That's right, partiers.

388
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,015
It's time to limbo,
limbo, limbo!

389
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,184
So, okay.
All right!

390
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,185
(Captain Jack)
I need a volunteer

391
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:13,895
to come up here
and hold my stick.

392
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,188
Huh, who's it gonna be?

393
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,690
Me.
Me, me, me, me, me, me!

394
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:17,857
Me, me, me.

395
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:19,734
Uh.

396
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:20,985
Usually, it's a woman.

397
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,654
I'm stronger.

398
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:23,822
Hey, I got an idea.

399
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,491
How would you like
to steer the ship, Dwight?

400
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:28,159
Keep us on a steady course.

401
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,161
Keep a sharp eye out,
I'm counting on you.

402
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,706
(Dwight)
I was the youngest pilot
in Pan Am history.

403
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:36,209
When I was four, the pilot
let me ride in the cockpit

404
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:39,129
and fly the plane with him.

405
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,506
And I was four
and I was great!

406
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,716
And I would have landed it,

407
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,093
but my dad wanted us
to go back to our seats.

408
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:48,054
[laid-back music playing]

409
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,057

Hey.

412
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,526
You know what the best way
of studying is?

413
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:03,486
At home?
Not on a boat?

414
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,822
Flash cards.
Flash cards.

415
00:15:05,864 --> 00:15:08,700
Doesn't really help me right
now because I'm on a boat.

416
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:12,328
You are gonna get seasick
if you keep reading in there.

417

[cheering]

419
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:21,296
(Captain Jack)
All right, all right.

420
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:24,466
That was great, now it's time
for the dance contest!

421
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:27,135
Why don't we do that after
I do my presentation and--

422
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,596
Nope!
Dance contest!

423
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,515
All right, we'll have a
motivationaldance contest.

424
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:33,975
Hit it!

425
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,186
Yeah, okay!

426
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:37,604
Dancing!

427
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:42,442
It is a primal art form
used in ancient times

428
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:47,238
to express yourself
with the body!

429
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,241
(Michael)
And communicate!

430
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,285

432
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,378
Sometimes you have
to take a break

433
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:03,505
from being the kind of boss

434
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,965
that's always trying
to teach people things.

435
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:09,302
Sometimes you have to just
to be the boss of dancing.

436
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,180

00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,307

* Early in the morning *

443
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:37,122
Hey, come inside
and talk to me.

444
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:38,707
I can't.

445
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,292
Do you want us
to run aground, woman?

446
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,877
[sighs]

00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,045

00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,215
Yeah! [laughs]
[applause]

449
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:49,968
All right, all right!
That was awesome!

450
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,261
All right, looks like

451
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:52,846
the guitar player's gonna take
a little break.

452
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,849
So this'll be a great time to
head on over to the taco bar.

453
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,017
All right.

454
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,351
That is a great way to kill
this party.

455
00:16:58,393 --> 00:17:00,478
Not on my watch.

456
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,274
Let's, uh, let's rock.

457
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,067
Let's rock some stuff here,
okay?

458
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,362
[playing poorly]
Wow. Okay.

459
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,780
[feedback screeching]

460
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,991
I'm hearing
a little too much reverb.

Can we down the reverb?

463
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:17,746
All right.

464
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,039

You know what?

00:17:48,943 --> 00:17:50,320
I don't think it's in--
I don't--

Well, I--

(Creed)
I don't know.

Make much out of it, Creed.

481
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,452
All right.
Good luck to you.

482
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,537
I don't know.

483
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,831
It is a defective axe,
my friend.

484
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,709
Uh, guys.
E blues. Follow me.

485
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,336

490
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:49,379
Back in the '60s,
I was with the Grass Roots

491
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:52,465
and we toured
with Janis Joplin,

492
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,426
the Doors, Cream.

493
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,219
We had a lot of fun.

494
00:18:56,261 --> 00:19:01,683
Now, I do quality assurance
for a paper company.

495
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:06,187
As you can imagine, uh,
drugs played a part.

496
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,814
They still do.
I, uh...

497
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,524
my work calls last
about 90 seconds

498
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:12,360

like, a quieter place
to hang out?

wait for Daryl to do his shot.

It's getting kind of
rowdy down there.

So.

I'm gonna see if I can sit in
with the band.

I wouldn't.
I've heard your stuff.

You can be nasty
when you drink.

You and Angela are the worst.

550
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:22,092
So, what's this presentation
all about?

551
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,969
Ah, see, this is
of general interest.

552
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:28,264
It is about...priorities.

553
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,058
And making decisions

554
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,434
using the boat
as an analogy.

555
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:32,977
What is important
to you?

556
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:35,730
If the boat is sinking,
what do you save?

557
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,107
Women and children.

558
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:38,441
No, no.

559
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,527
Salesmen and profit centers.

560
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,237
That's a stupid analogy.

561
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,698
Okay.
Well, obviously,

562
00:22:44,739 --> 00:22:47,450
you don't know anything
about leadership.

563
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:48,618
Well, I was the captain

564
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,537
of a PC-1 Cyclone
Coastal Patrol Boat

565
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:52,330

Wow, you should be
the motivational speaker.

00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:56,960
Him?
Okay.

568
00:22:57,002 --> 00:22:59,546
Yeah, he gives me
real responsibility, Michael.

569
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,089
Captain Jack delegates.

570
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,675
He's let me steer the ship
for the last hour.

571
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:07,595
I'd like to be engaged.

572
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:09,514
How did you manage
to pull that off?

573
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,933
[laughing] Um.

574
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:14,436
Uh, I've been engaged
for three years

575
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,521
and there's no end
in sight,

576
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:19,065
so you don't want to ask
my advice.

577
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,192
Suppose your office
building's on fire.

578
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,277
Jim.

579
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:23,278
Who would you save?

580
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:26,614
Um...let's see, uh...

581
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:32,412
The customer.
'Cause the customer is king.

582
00:23:32,454 --> 00:23:33,872
Not what I was looking for,
but a good thought.

00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,915
He's just sucking up.

584
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:37,167
When you were
in the Navy,

585
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:39,711
did you, um,
ever almost die?

(Captain Jack)
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

587
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:42,255
And I wasn't
thinking about

588
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:43,423
some customer.

my first wife.

The day I got back
on shore, I married her.

You know what?
I would save the receptionist.

592
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,853
I just wanted to clear that up.

(Roy)
Hey, everybody,

595
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:05,195
could I have your attention
for just a second?

596
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,363
Would you listen
to me for a second?

597
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:07,864
Um, we were up
at the front

598
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,574
and we were talking about
what's really important and--

599
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:12,786
Pam, um...

600
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,329
I think enough is enough.

601
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,456
I think we should set a date
for our wedding.

602
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:17,916
'Bout June 10th?

You know what, I don't want
to take credit for this.

615
00:24:41,606 --> 00:24:43,400
But Roy and I were just
having a conversation

616
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:48,530
about making commitments
and making choices, right?

617
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:49,864
Did I motivate you?

618
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,533
No, it was,
it was Captain Jack.

619
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,993
Well--
Captain Jack!

620
00:24:54,035 --> 00:24:55,412
Could have
been either one of us

621
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,372
because, pretty much,
we were saying the same thing.

622
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,541
Congratulations,
that is great.

I can marry you right now

00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:10,593
Yes!

628
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,179
I can marry you as Regional
Manager of Dunder Mifflin!

629
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:15,807
No, no, no, no, I want
my mom and dad to be there.

630

Didn't really, uh prepare
anything to say.

00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,818
Uh, we were all caught
pretty unprepared

Uh, I want to congratulate
the happy couple.

00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:40,225
You know, they say that
marriage is an institution.

656
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:43,311
And I say who wants to be
in an institution?

What is that?

6
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,202
- I don't know. 3-2.
- That's not even--no.

7
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,246
- You broke. 3-2.
[phone ringing]

8
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:40,957
Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.

9
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:42,292
- Pam! It's Michael.
Help me.

10
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:43,585
I need help right now.

11
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,128
- Michael, what's wrong?
- I'm hurt.

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,088
I have hurt myself.

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,381
Oh, my God!
- Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

14
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,592
- Oh, this is not
looking good, Pam.

15
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,344
- Michael, do you need me
to call an ambulance?!

16
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,762
- No, I want you
to pick me up.

17
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,347
- Okay. Wait a sec.
- What's going on?

18
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,681
- I thought you said
that you were hurt.

19
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,725
- I am hurt.
I hurt my foot.

20
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,477
I want to come to work,

21
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,562
but I need you
to come and pick me up.

22
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,147
[on speaker phone]
Oh, God!

23
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,274
- Hey, whoa! Michael!
- Oh, God!

24
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,193
- It's okay.
It's Jim.

25
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,695
Just say again, really loudly,
what happened.

26
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,365
- Okay. Buh!
I burned my foot!

27
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:15,700
Very badly,
on my Foreman Grill,

28
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,370
and I now need someone to
come and bring me in to work.

29
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,207
- You burned your foot
on a Foreman Grill?

30
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,708
- I enjoy
having breakfast in bed.

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,543
I like waking up
to the smell of bacon.

32
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:26,503
Sue me.

33
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,046
And since
I don't have a butler,

34
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,381
I have to do it myself.

35
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,925
So most nights,
before I go to bed,

36
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,929
I will lay six strips of bacon
out on my George Foreman Grill.

37
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,430
Then I go to sleep.

38
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,058
When I wake up,
I plug in the grill.

39
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,810
I go back to sleep again.

40
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:46,231
Then, I wake up to the smell
of crackling bacon.

41
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,149
It is delicious.
It's good for me.

42
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,318
It's the perfect way
to start the day.

43
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,405
Today I got up,
I stepped onto the grill,

44
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,281
and it clamped down
on my foot, that's it.

45
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,992
I don't see what's so hard
to believe about that.

46
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:00,370
- I've had a Foreman Grill
for about six years.

47
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:03,081
I've done about 85%
of my cooking on it,

48
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,457
but I've never burnt myself.

49
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,419
Probably because
I don't use it as a pillow.

50
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,254
- Pam, could you
come get me?

51
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,673
- Uh, I have to stay here
and answer the phone.

52
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:14,259
- Okay, could someone come
and get me, please? Ryan?

53
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,844
- Michael, you should
stay home and rest.

54
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,429
- There's no toilet paper
here.

55
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,347
Could Ryan--tell Ryan
to bring toilet paper!

56
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,932
Could you tell him that?

57
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,017
- Can you hop?

58
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,435
- I tried hopping, Kevin,

59
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,854
and I bumped my elbow
against the wall,

60
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:29,274
and now my elbow
has a "protruberence."

61
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,276
- [snorts]

62
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:33,278
- No one wants
to pick me up?!

63
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,073
- What is going on?

64
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,324
What is going on?

65
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,784
- Michael is, um, "sick,"

66
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,327
and he wants one of us
to rescue him.

67
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,288
- I'm not sick. I'm--
- I'm coming, Michael!

68
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,706
I'm gonna save you!
- Don't!

69
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,624
Is that Dwight?
I do not want Dwight.

70
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,626
- Hold on, Michael!
I am coming!

71
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,670
Wait there!
- I don't want Dwight!

72
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,589
- Michael, why don't you
call your girlfriend?

73
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,049
- I don't have a girlfriend.

74
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,925
- But you said you went out
with her this weekend.

75
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:58,136
- It was all made up.
Just--someone come, okay?

76
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,138
Anyone.
Anyone but Dwight.

77
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,473
[car crashes]

78
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,350
- What was that?
- What was that?

79
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,896
- Oh.
- Oh!

80
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,439
- He hit the pole.

81
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,318
It's broken, right? He can't--
- Oh, my gosh.

82
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,154
- Oh, Dwight.
Dwight.

83
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,614
Oh!
- Oh!

84
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,491
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my gosh.

85
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,159
- Is he okay?
[tires screech]

86
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,536
- He's still driving.

87
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,163
Dwight...

88
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,165
You forgot your bumper!

89
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,042
- Hello?

90
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,168
Please don't send Dwight.

91
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,171
[upbeat music]

92
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:40,387
* *

93
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,917
- Morning, everyone.

94
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,252
Don't freak out.

95
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:14,462
I forbid anybody to freak out.

96
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,048
Clearly I have had
a very serious accident,

97
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,591
but I will recover.

98
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,093
God willing.

99
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:21,928
I just wanna be
treated normally today.

100
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,263
Normal would actually be good,

101
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:25,181
considering the trauma
that I've been through--

102
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,017
- You missed two big
conference calls today,

103
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,184
one with corporate.

104
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,854
- Oh, did you explain why?

105
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,189
- No, I didn't mention
that you cooked your foot.

106
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,649
- Burned my foot, Pam.

107
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,942
[bubble wrap pops]

108
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,610
- You should put butter on it.

109
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,487
- Uh, that's what she said.

110
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:40,780
See? I haven't lost
my sense of humor.

111
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,158
No. No need.
It was a non-stick grill.

112
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,036
Please stop popping my cast.

113
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,162
Thank you.

114
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,123
- So where are you
shipping your foot?

115
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:53,126
- [dryly] Ha ha ha.
So where are you shipping...

116
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,004
- Your foot.

117
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,966
- I always keep a stash
of bubble wrap at my house.

118
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,218
Some days--
hectic, tiring days--

119
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,429
I just like to go home
and zone out,

120
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,598
click on the tube,
and pop a few.

121
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,641
It's very soothing.

122
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,602
[bubble wrap pops]

123
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,103
You wanna try?

124
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,314
- You know, that's probably
not gonna last too long.

125
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:15,982
You should go to a hospital
and get a real cast.

126
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,817
- Right, like I'm gonna
spend the day in a hospital.

127
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,236
Ugh, bureaucracy and germs.

128
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,696
- And doctors.
- Yes.

129
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,406
So, no, thank you.
- [slurs speech]

130
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,657
- What?

131
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,660
- Constructing
a homemade cast--genius.

132
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,829
Filled with foresight.

133
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,749
Like in the pioneer times,
if you lost a leg,

134
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,794
they would then use the bone
of the leg for a cane.

135
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,003
They wasted nothing.

136
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,923
- Wow, I don't want
to hear...you talk.

137
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,300
Pam, could I have a word
with you in my office?

138
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,968
[grunts]

139
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,763
[thud]
I'm all right.

140
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:48,640
[buzzing]
Thank you.

141
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,810
Pam, messages, please.

142
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,396
- You didn't have any.
- Really?

143
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:58,358
Well, seemed very important
to you earlier,

144
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,235
that you needed to stay and--

145
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,861
- Do my job?
- No.

146
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,531
Your job is being
my friend, Pam, and--

147
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,199
Ow!
God!

148
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:07,367
- It slipped.

149
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:08,576
- What did--
- Sorry.

150
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:09,786
- It's just that before,
you said

151
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,371
you didn't want
any special treatment.

152
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,707
- I don't want
any special treatment, Pam.

153
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:17,460
I just want you to treat me
like you would a family member

154
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,797
who's undergone some sort
of serious physical trauma.

155
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,257
I don't think
that's too much to ask.

156
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,216
- Do you want some aspirin?

157
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,592
Because you seem
a little fussy.

158
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,761
- No, I don't want some
aspirin. Yeah, I am fussy!

159
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,221
Aspirin's not gonna do
a damn thing.

160
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:31,057
I'm sitting here with
a bloody stump of a foot.

161
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,560
- Pam, I am
assistant regional manager.

162
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,603
And I can take care of him.

163
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,814
Part of my duties are to...

164
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,777
- [sighs]

165
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,739
What?

166
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,032
Part of your duties
are to, what?

167
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,575
- What?

168
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,077
- You just said that part of
your duties are to, something.

169
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,787
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

170
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,707
What is wrong with you?
- What is wrong with you?

171
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,500
- I don't want you
taking care of me.

172
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,668
He almost killed me in the car.

173
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,420
Car ride from hell.

174
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,756
And his car smelled of puke.

175
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,924
- I vomited because I crashed

176
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,427
on the way to pick you up
and bring you in to work.

177
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,637
- TMI. I don't--God.

178
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,639
I hope you washed your hands
before you--

179
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,058
- Well, I didn't.
- Hey.

180
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,186
- Vomit hands.
- What is wrong with you?

181
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,938
What is up with him?

182
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,732
- He seems kind of out of it.

183
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,193
- Like that's anything
out of the ordinary.

184
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,611
He just wants attention.

185
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,321
[sighs]

186
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,490
Oh, Pam?
- Mm-hmm?

187
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,117
- Would you be a dear
and get me some hot water,

188
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,204
that's cold water,
and an assortment of tea bags?

189
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,205
Thanks.

190
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,229
- What'd you get?

191
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,730
- Oh, it's nothing.

192
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,607
- Oh, did Roy get you an iPod.
That's cool.

193
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,818
- It's a Prism DuroSport.

194
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,195
It's not an iPod,
but it's good for athletes.

195
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,863
- Mm-hmm. Awesome.

196
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,962
- Well, you know, uh,

197
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,714
you know, frankly, a lot of us
have been saying

198
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,007
something like this
for a long time.

199
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,591
- Yeah, I've been saying that.
- Yeah.

200
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,343
And, you know, I think that

201
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,679
the very fact that we're
including it in our agenda,

202
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,014
frankly,
is a big step forward.

203
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:36,016
- Did you know
I used to be in HR?

204
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,018
- I'm sorry?
- I used to be in HR.

205
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,478
- Uh--
- I was a hellraiser.

206
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,646
- Okay...
- Right?!

207
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,897
[laughs]

208
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,816
- Great.
Um, why don't we move on?

209
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,568
- All right.
Moving on.

210
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,903
- Great, because I think that,
you know, the very fact that--

211
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,697
- Ryan, yeah! You're here.
What you got?

212
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:53,199
What you got?
What you got?

213
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,535
All right. "Panic Room,"
"Maverick," "Nell,"

214
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:56,745
"Sommersby," "The Accused."

215
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,246
Where's "Little Man Tate"?
- They were out.

216
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,331
- Aw. Come on, man.
- At three different places.

217
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,875
- It's not
a Jodie Foster afternoon

218
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,877
without "Little Man Tate,"
buddy.

219
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:06,588
[sighs]
All right.

220
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,881
Where is my cornbread?

221
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,382
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

222
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,343
Did you get all dark meat
like I like?

223
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:13,803
- Yes, I ordered three full
rotisserie chickens' worth

224
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,055
of all dark meat.

225
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,598
- Where are the yams?
- They were out of yams.

226
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,017
I got you creamed spinach.
- Did you go to the one

227
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,268
in Stroudsburg?
- Yes.

228
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,645
- It's the only Boston Kitchen
I trust.

229
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,481
- I know.
You made that very clear.

230
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,274
- And they had no yams?
- They had no yams.

231
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,233
- How strange.

232
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,401
Because they always have yams.

233
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:29,903
- Well, I don't know
what to tell you.

234
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,322
- [muffled]
Well...

235
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,406
Chicken's cold.

236
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,784
- Yes. Stroudsburg is
45 minutes away.

237
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,535
- You know what else is
45 minutes away?

238
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,914
Going to the Boston Kitchen
in Scranton

239
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,957
and then fooling around
in the parking lot.

240
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,418
That's--that's 45 minutes away.

241
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:49,130
Mmm! I'm telling ya,

242
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:52,342
the best cure in the world
is comfort food.

243
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,844
You know how they say,
"Stuff a cold"?

244
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:56,846
Well, I don't care
what you got--

245
00:09:56,888 --> 00:10:00,892
the flu, Lyme disease,
emphysema--

246
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,561
you eat an entire
dark meat chicken,

247
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,979
you can walk on the moon.

248
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,944
- Oh, man.
Is that a Prism DuroSport?

249
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,320
- You've seen
one of these?

250
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:15,156
- Yeah, they're like an iPod,
only they're better,

251
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,784
'cause they're chunkier
and more solid.

252
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,119
- Roy gave it to me
for Christmas.

253
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,995
I'm trying to figure out
how to put songs on it.

254
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,665
- Oh, no, no, no.
Don't go there.

255
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:25,125
I know this Russian website

256
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,919
where you can download songs
for 2¢ apiece.

257
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,087
- Really?
- Yeah.

258
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,131
I'll write down the address
for you.

259
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,425
Only--the only thing is,

260
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,302
is that all the songs
are in Russian.

261
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,974
Kidding!

262
00:10:41,016 --> 00:10:43,435
- Oh!
[both laugh]

263
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,561
- Why would they all be?

264
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,941
Okay.
See you later, Pan.

265
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:55,989
- "Pan"?

266
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,491
- Pam!

267
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,076
Pam?

268
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,121
- [sighs]
Oh, God.

269
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,956
[phone ringing]

270
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:06,291
- What?

271
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,876
- [whimpering]
Come here, please.

272
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,462
- Tell me
before I come there.

273
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,172
- I want you to rub butter
on my foot.

274
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,382
- No.
- Pam, please.

275
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,343
I have Country Crock.
- No.

276
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,677
- I'll do it!

277
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,887
I used to be a nurse.

278
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,347
- No, your hands are grizzled.

279
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,057
- I can be very tender,
Michael.

280
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,809
- [gags]
Come on, Pam. Please.

281
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,061
- No.

282
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,982
- [grunting]

283
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,234
Ryan!

284
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,861
Ryan!

285
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,905
[rattling blinds]
Rya--

286
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,408
- [sniffs]
Ooh! Who made popcorn?

287
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,583
- These covers

288
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,752
are totally indestructible.

289
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:51,961
- Really?
- Yeah.

290
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,297
Throw it.
I promise it won't break.

291
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:55,340
Chuck it.

292
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,305
Oh, no.
It's broken.

293
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:03,390
- What?

294
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,933
- No, it's fine.

295
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,059
I told you it wouldn't break.

296
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,644
You could throw it
all day long.

297
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,854
- That is so cool.

298
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,147
Thanks, Dwight.
- Yep.

299
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:18,029
- So I guess Pam and Dwight
are friends now.

300
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,323
- Oh, God, no.
Dwight isn't my friend.

301
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,662
Oh, my God.
Dwight's kind of my friend!

302
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:29,290
- No, no. No one is
helping me out at all, Mom.

303
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:33,003
- No, I'm not gonna call Jan.

304
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,254
She'd just worry.

305
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,464
Drive down here
and make a big thing.

306
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:40,677
Who told you that?

307
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:44,014
No, it was mutual.

308
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,099
And what is Pam doing
chatting with you?

309
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,481
- Hmm.

310
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,775
You like candy?

311
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,445
- It's all right.

312
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,113
- 'Cause you're sweeter
than candy.

313
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,740
- What is wrong with you?

314
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,326
Hey, cut--

315
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,732
- Wow, you just dive right in.

316
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,108
- You know, around age 12,

317
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,443
I just started going for it,
you know?

318
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,570
- Help!
[loud thud]

319
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,739
[groaning]

320
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,200
Oh, help!
Help me!

321
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,951
- What--what happened?

322
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,496
- I fell off the toilet.

323
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:53,333
I'm caught between
the toilet and the wall.

324
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,002
- What do you need?
- Not you.

325
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,587
Someone else.
Get Pam.

326
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,756
- I don't think Pam's gonna
wanna come into the men's room.

327
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:01,257
- Get Ryan.
[grunts]

328
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,134
He needs to lift me!

329
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,886
And he needs to clean me up
a little bit.

330
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,930
Bring a wet towel.

331
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:10,225
- Ryan is, uh...dead.

332
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,519
- No, he's not.
I just saw him.

333
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,563
- No. Can you--
can you just get up yourself?

334
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,941
I...you only grilled your foot.

335
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,776
- Oh, forget it.

336
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,736
I'll just get up myself.

337
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,071
Oh! Ow!

338
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,824
[clattering]

339
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,368
Ow! Oh, God!

340
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,248
- Do you think Dwight's
being a little weird today?

341
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,043
- No. He's actually been
really nice and helpful.

342
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:40,505
- And that isn't weird?

343
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,133
- Well...

344
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,301
- Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

345
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,054
Phyllis. Oscar.

346
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,890
Ryan, who is supposed
to be dead.

347
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,851
Can I ask you all a question?

348
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,021
Do you know what it's like
to be disabled?

349
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,315
- Um, I had scoliosis
as a girl.

350
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,860
- Never heard of it.
No. A real disability.

351
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,153
Not a woman's trouble.

352
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,864
- When I was a teenager,
I was in an iron lung.

353
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,866
- Wha--how old are you?

354
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,159
No, it--

355
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,870
Look, the point is

356
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,538
I am the only one here

357
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,000
who has
a legitimate disability.

358
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,127
Although I'm sure
Stanley has had

359
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:21,546
his fair share of obstacles.

360
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:24,049
- I'm not disabled,
and neither are you.

361
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:28,928
- Okay, what does this
look like to you, Stanley?

362
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,764
- Mailboxes, etc.

363
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,724
- Shut it.

364
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:35,268
Okay.
Well...

365
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,770
Well, you know what?

366
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,313
Disabilities

367
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:40,774
are not things to be laughed at

368
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,776
or laughed about.

369
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,444
You people are jerks.

370
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:47,322
Imagine if you had
left Stevie Wonder

371
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,574
on the floor of that bathroom
instead of me.

372
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,910
- Oh, we wouldn't.
We love Stevie Wonder.

373
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,328
- [sighs]

374
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:58,166
I burned my foot!

375
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,002
Okay, 20 minutes.
Conference room.

376
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,504
Everybody's in there!

377
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,465
- Dad?

378
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,808
- It is so clear to me now.

379
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,602
They only loved me
when I was strong

380
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,813
and walking around.

381
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,232
That is so prejudiced.

382
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,650
What?
You gotta be kidding me.

383
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,902
Why are they arranged this way?

384
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,570
Dwight? Hello?!

385
00:16:27,612 --> 00:16:28,780
Why did you do this?

386
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,448
And what kind of boss am I

387
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,909
to have raised such
an insensitive group?

388
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,411
[sighs]

389
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,205
I give you a little,
tiny, tiny task

390
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:40,417
and all I ask is that you--
we need leg room.

391
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,836
We need leg room
for people to sit.

392
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:44,379
- What are you talking about?

393
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:47,048
- This is not the luge, okay?!

394
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,676
I'd rather be loved
than feared.

395
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,011
But if I'm not loved,

396
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:54,431
at the very minimum,
I should be feared.

397
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,182
And if they're
not scared of me,

398
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,601
the least I can do is
call a big meeting

399
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:01,396
and force them all
to stop what they're doing

400
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,356
and to pay attention to me.

401
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,860
While we are waiting for
our special guest to arrive,

402
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:08,778
I wanted you all to take a look

403
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,657
at a few of the many,
many disabled icons

404
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,743
who have contributed so much
to our society.

405
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,411
- Quick question.
- Yeah?

406
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,246
- Why is Tom Hanks
on the wall?

407
00:17:18,288 --> 00:17:20,457
- Twice.
- Good question.

408
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:23,376
"Forrest Gump,"
mentally challenged.

409
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,337
"Philadelphia," AIDS.

410
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,589
- I think that's from "Big."

411
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,091
- I don't think so, no.

412
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,510
- Yeah, he's dancing on a piano
with Robert Loggia.

413
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,596
- He grew into a man
overnight.

414
00:17:34,637 --> 00:17:36,473
A rare disability.
It still works.

415
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,683
[clicks tongue, then sighs]

416
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,226
A crossword puzzle, Stanley?

417
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,520
Seriously, are you
learning nothing here?

418
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:43,855
- Mm-hmm.

419
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,690
- What do you mean,
"Mm-hmm"?

420
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,650
- I mean I'm learning nothing.
- Okay.

421
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:49,486
- Michael Scott.
I'm looking for Michael Scott.

422
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,197
- Yes. Right in here.
- Oh, good.

423
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,823
- Come on in.
- Great.

424
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:57,535
- This, ladies and gentlemen,
is our special guest.

425
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:58,953
- Sorry I'm late.

426
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,415
Somebody parked in
the handicapped parking space.

427
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:03,500
- Oh.

428
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,960
- My assignment is to make

429
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:09,339
a temporary
disabled parking permit

430
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:11,424
for Michael Scott.

431
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,593
- Hey, everyone.
I'm Billy Merchant.

432
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:15,136
You may have seen me
around here before.

433
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,139
I'm the properties manager
of this office park.

434
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:19,683
- You are so brave.

435
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,476
You are so brave.
- Thank you.

436
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,728
Actually, I've been meaning to
come by here for a long time--

437
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,271
- But it's hard for you, right?

438
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,315
Because you're in a wheelchair.

439
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,275
- No, I just have a lot
of properties to manage.

440
00:18:29,317 --> 00:18:30,985
- Let me ask you something.

441
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:33,780
How long does it take
for you to do something simple?

442
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,116
Every day, like--like brush
your teeth in the morning?

443
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,159
- I don't know.
Like, 30 seconds.

444
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,577
- Oh, my God.

445
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,831
That's three times
as long as it takes me.

446
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:45,083
How did you
get in your wheelchair?

447
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:46,459
- This morning?

448
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:48,503
Just like every other morning.
Just climbed on in.

449
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,255
[laughter]
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

450
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:52,841
Not funny, not funny!
- Hey, hey, relax.

451
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,676
Just, uh, joking around here.

452
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:55,844
- Well, that's good.

453
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,721
He still has a sense of humor.

454
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:58,972
- Listen, I've actually
used a chair

455
00:18:59,014 --> 00:19:00,849
since I was four years old.

456
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,058
I don't really
notice it anymore.

457
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,351
- Well, they do.
They notice it.

458
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:04,811
Don't you?
You notice it.

459
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,563
It's the first thing you saw
when he rolled in here,

460
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,314
isn't it?

461
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,526
- I want to clamp Michael's
face in a George Foreman Grill.

462
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:12,694
- So there are just
a couple things

463
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,029
I wanted
to remind everybody of.

464
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,322
- Okay.
- First is parking.

465
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:17,782
You can't block
the freight entrance

466
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,826
with your car,
even if your blinkers are on.

467
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:22,328
Does anybody
have any questions?

468
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,329
Yes?

469
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,916
Yeah?

470
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,044
Yes?

471
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,795
- Dwight, you have
your hand up.

472
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,300
- Ignore him.

473
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,761
- Real question:
when we're up on the roof,

474
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:39,137
are we allowed
to bring food up there?

475
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,848
- No one should be on the roof.
- Oh.

476
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,393
- You fought for our side

477
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:47,562
in the Vietnam War.

478
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:48,938
What was that like?

479
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,441
- Michael, I did not fight
in Vietnam.

480
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,068
- You know what?

481
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,903
We're not that different,
you and I.

482
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,405
When I clamped my foot

483
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:58,656
into a non-stick--

484
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,200
- You know what, Michael?
- Yeah?

485
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:02,077
- Let me stop you right there.
- Okay.

486
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,328
- And leave.

487
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,997
- Did you see
"Born on the Fourth of July"?

488
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:07,248
I was under the impression

489
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,376
that Billy would be
more like that guy.

490
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,460
- And the funny thing is,

491
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:11,920
I think I had actually
convinced myself

492
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,464
that those meetings
couldn't get any worse.

493
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,049
Hey. What's up, Billy?

494
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,301
- What's wrong with that guy?
- You mean today?

495
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:20,887
He stepped on a George Foreman
Grill and he burned his foot.

496
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,222
- No, not Michael.

497
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,766
The moon-faced kid
who crashed into the pole.

498
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,312
He looks like
he has a concussion.

499
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,359
- Okay. Headaches.

500
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,611
Changes in ability
to think and concentrate.

501
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,029
Changes in personality.

502
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,989
All signs of a concussion.

503
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,701
- Okay, we have our diagnosis.

504
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,327
- Is it weird that
I like him better now

505
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:46,287
that he has a concussion?

506
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:48,790
- Look, I feel fine.

507
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:50,500
As a volunteer
sheriff's deputy,

508
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:52,627
I have been trained
to notice all the signs

509
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:54,045
of a concussion.

510
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:57,173
One of them is slurred speech,
okay?

511
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:00,093
Uh, number three,
shortness of breath.

512
00:21:00,135 --> 00:21:01,970
There are four things
you have to remember.

513
00:21:02,012 --> 00:21:05,306
One, I am faster
than 80% of all snakes.

514
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,766
Also...

515
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,478
[bubble wrap pops]

516
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,813
- Hey!
- Here.

517
00:21:11,855 --> 00:21:13,148
I found the pudding cups
you wanted

518
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,483
at a gas station in Carbondale!

519
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,777
- You did it.
Look at you.

520
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,738
And with the plate
and the napkin.

521
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,406
Very nice.
Thank you, Ryan.

522
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:23,366
- You're very welcome.
- Did you get the yams?

523
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,535
- No, the gas station
in Carbondale

524
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:26,745
did not have fresh yams.

525
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,039
- [sighs]
Okay.

526
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,957
I'll just have the pudding.
- You sure?

527
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,500
- Yeah.
- Okay.

528
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,919
- You know what?
I feel better.

529
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,296
Ryan brought me
some chocolate pudding,

530
00:21:36,338 --> 00:21:38,798
and his kindness
healed my foot.

531
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:41,676
Yeah, baby!

532
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:44,012
I am feelin' better.

533
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,348
My body's literally
healing itself.

534
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,641
It is amazing what
the human body is capable of

535
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:50,352
when you have a powerful brain.

536
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:53,355
- I ground up
four extra-strength aspirin

537
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,523
and put them
in Michael's pudding.

538
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:57,025
I do the same thing with my dog

539
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:59,778
to get him to take
his heartworm medicine.

540
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:03,948
- Oh, finally feel the blood
coursing through my foot veins.

541
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,950
[thud]
- [groans]

542
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,370
- Oh! Okay, I think
we need to take him

543
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:10,038
to the hospital, because

544
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,831
I'm pretty sure
he has a concussion.

545
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:14,501
- Oh, now you feel
some compassion for him.

546
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:15,502
- He needs to go
right now.

547
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:16,836
And you're
his emergency contact.

548
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:17,962
I think you should go with him.

549
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,381
- Why don't you go with him?

550
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,216
- I...barely know him.
- I want Michael to take me.

551
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,051
- I can't take you.
I don't have my car.

552
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,427
- Please?
- And yours is all vomity.

553
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,553
- You can take my van!

554
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:27,430
- Oh, okay.
That's great.

555
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,516
No, I can't drive.
Jim, why don't you drive?

556
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,725
- Fine.

557
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,227
- We'll go.
I'm still recovering.

558
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,062
So let's just--Ryan,
can you get my coat, please?

559
00:22:34,104 --> 00:22:36,064
- Slowly. Let's just get
to the elevator.

560
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,066
-[imitating helicopter]
- What are you doing?

561
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:39,067
- Vietnam sounds.
- Stop.

562
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,653
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

563
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:43,029
- Tired.
- You can't lay down.

564
00:22:43,071 --> 00:22:44,656
- Just take a rake--
- Wake up!

565
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:45,865
- Ah!
- Wait. Here.

566
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,492
Let me help you, Dwight.
- Okay, Pam.

567
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:49,369
- Get up. Get up.
- Thanks. You're the best.

568
00:22:49,411 --> 00:22:50,495
- Yeah.
- Just keep him awake.

569
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:52,497
- It smells like chicken soup.
- I know.

570
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,874
- I have to go to the hospital.
- I know.

571
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,084
- Where are we going?

572
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,377
- I just want to say goodbye,
okay?

573
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,087
- I'll be back. I mean...
- Yes, I know.

574
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,214
But it's gonna be different.
- Why?

575
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,924
- It's just hard to explain.

576
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,759
- Oh, Pam.
You're adorable.

577
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:06,302
- Oh, my goodness.

578
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:08,096
- [giggles]
- Come here.

579
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,390
- Oh!
Huggy hugs.

580
00:23:10,432 --> 00:23:12,183
- Okay. Come here.

581
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,685
- Okay.
- Come here.

582
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:16,229
- No, not you--no!
God, Dwight!

583
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,939
- Okay, I got it.
- Okay.

584
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:20,942
- Why is there a camera?
- All right. Let's go.

585
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:22,360
Get in here, for a second.
- Okay.

586
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,612
All right, Jim.
- All right.

587
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,573
All right.
- Don't puke.

588
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,907
Shotgun!

589
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:29,284
- You don't think
you should sit in the back

590
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,578
with Dwight?
- [scoffs]

591
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,872
The rules of shotgun are
very simple and very clear.

592
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,166
The first person
to shout "shotgun"

593
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,792
when you're within
the sight of the car

594
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,294
gets the front seat.

595
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,421
That's how the game's played.

596
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:43,923
There are no exceptions
for someone with a concussion.

597
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:46,176
Oh, God.
A minivan.

598
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,803
What is Meredith's problem?

599
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:50,180
- Well, I think she has a kid.

600
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:51,848
- Yeah, she has one kid
and no husband.

601
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,059
And she's not gonna find one
driving this thing around.

602
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,353
- Where are we going?
- All right.

603
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,104
Get inside.
- Where are we going?

604
00:23:58,146 --> 00:23:59,647
- We're going
to Chuck E. Cheese.

605
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:00,815
- Chuck E. Cheese?
Oh, God.

606
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:02,984
I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.

607
00:24:03,026 --> 00:24:04,694
- We're going to the hospital,
Michael.

608
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:06,946
- I know.
I'm just sayin'.

609
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:11,326
Dwight, what are you drinking?
- I found it under the seat.

610
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:12,994
- Oh, my God.
Dwight.

611
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:14,162
Put that down.
- I'm thirsty--no!

612
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:15,413
- Give the bottle to Michael.
- No!

613
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,040
- Give the bottle to Michael.
- I'm thirsty!

614
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:18,166
- Give it to me, Dwight!
- No.

615
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:19,334
- Just keep your eyes
on the road.

616
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,669
Give me the bottle,
or you're fired!

617
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,712
- You can't fire me.
I don't work in this van.

618
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:24,005
- Give it to me, Dwight!
- No.

619
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:25,507
- Give me the bottle!
- Stop. Will you stop?

620
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,217
- Give me the bottle, Dwight!
- Michael, stop!

621
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:29,010
- Just give it!
- Michael, stop! Stop.

622
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,887
- Stop it! Stop spraying!
- Ah!

623
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:32,222
- Give me the bottle!
- Stop!

624
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,849
- Stop spraying me!
Give me the bottle!

625
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:37,352
Dwight, what is
your middle name?

626
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,229
- Danger.

627
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,689
- Something with a "K."

628
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,023
- It's Kurt.

629
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:44,317
Wow, I'm so sad
that I know that.

630
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:47,612
- What do I write under
"reason for visit"?

631
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:48,905
- Concussion.

632
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:52,742
What did you write?

633
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,495
- [clears throat]
Nothing.

634
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,872
I wrote, "Bringing someone
to the hospital."

635
00:24:57,914 --> 00:24:59,207
- So you thought
they meant your reason

636
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:00,291
for coming to the hospital.

637
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,334
- No, no.
You know what, Jim?

638
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,878
This isn't about me anymore.

639
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,380
I made a miraculous recovery,

640
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,465
which is more
than I can say for him.

641
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:08,675
- Come on, Dwight.

642
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,760
- [sputters]

643
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:13,304
Hi, Michael.
- Hi, Dwight.

644
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,723
- Ah.

645
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,433
Uh.

646
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,518
- Doctor, what is more serious?

647
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,520
A head injury,
or a foot injury?

648
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:21,730
- A head injury.

649
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,273
- Well, you don't have
all the information.

650
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:24,899
The foot has been
fairly severely burned,

651
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:26,609
and, uh, healed quickly.

652
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:27,944
Very quickly.

653
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:30,071
Actually, like,
suspiciously quickly.

654
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,032
- So I'm ordering a CAT scan.

655
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:33,450
- What is that?

656
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:35,952
- Look, since you have
the machine up and running,

657
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:37,245
can I just stick my foot in?

658
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:39,330
We can take a look.
- Well...

659
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,457
For a burn,
you really just need

660
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:41,958
to look at the outside
of the foot.

661
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,960
- Okay, what kind
of machine is that?

662
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:45,920
- Does the skin
look red and swollen?

663
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,088
- That's what she said.

664
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,091
- That's my joke.
Damn it, Dwight.

665
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,052
He stole my joke.
- That's very funny.

666
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,678
Very smart.

667
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,889
We need to get your friend
into the CT machine.

668
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,724
- Into a machine?

669
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,101
Okay, uh...

670
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:01,728
That's bad.
Will you stay with me?

671
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,021
- No.
- Okay.

672
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,397
Will you please
call my cousin, Mose?

673
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:06,191
- No, I'm not calling
your weirdo cousin.

674
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,902
27 years old.
Never left the beet farm.

675
00:26:08,943 --> 00:26:11,821
- God...God...
- Oh, God.

676
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:13,573
- Oh, God.
- Okay!

677
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:15,533
I'll stand near you.

678
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:18,620
- Next to me?
- Next-ish.

679
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:22,791
- Okay, no electronics
past this point.

680
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:23,958
Camera, sound equipment.

681
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,001
- It's okay.
They're with me.

682
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:27,003
- No metal of any kind.

683
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:29,839
- All right. Well, I guess
this is where we leave you off.

684
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:31,132
- I don't wanna do this.

685
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:32,759
- Uh, well, you should have
thought of that

686
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:35,470
before you crashed your head on
your way to pick me up, so...

687
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:39,057
We'll see you when you get out.

688
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,308
- Oh.

689
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,146
- Fine. Fine.

690
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:52,362
[mic turns off]

691
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,285
[phone rings]

692
00:26:59,327 --> 00:27:00,537
- Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.

693
00:27:00,578 --> 00:27:02,497
- Dunder Mifflin.
This is Jim.

694
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:04,040
- Oh, my God.
What's going on?

695
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:05,333
Is Dwight okay?
- Mm-hmm.

696
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,876
He should be fine,
but they brought him in

697
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:08,086
for a CAT scan.

698
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,838
- I can't believe
he's getting a CAT scan.

699
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,673
- Michael went in there
with him too.

700
00:27:11,715 --> 00:27:12,841
It's pretty sweet.

701
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:14,467
- Really?
Michael went in with him?

702
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:15,719
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

703
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,262
- But they shouldn't be
much longer now,

704
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:18,263
so we'll be back soon.

705
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,597
- Okay, that's...good news.

706
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:22,851
- Um, uh, yeah.
No, I'll let you go.

707
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:24,602
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

708
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:34,696
Hey, Oscar?
- What's up, Pam?

709
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,197
- Um, I just wanted
to let you know

710
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:37,907
that Dwight's gonna be okay.

711
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:39,784
The doctor said there's
a really simple treatment

712
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,745
for a concussion,
so he'll probably even

713
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,038
be back at work tomorrow.

714
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:44,372
- Okay?

715
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:46,374
- I just, uh, thought
you'd wanna know that.

716
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:53,048
- Okay, Mr. Schrute.

717
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,133
Inhale with me on three.

718
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:57,052
One, two...

719
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:59,179
Sir, stop that.

720
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,764
Stop!

721
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,295
[bugle toots]

722
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:33,672
[ascending tone]

1
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:17,934
- What?

2
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,185
- Oh, nothing.

3
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,313
Pam's on vacation,

4
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,732
and she gets back tomorrow.

5
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,692
So it'll be nice to see her.

6
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:26,735
It'll be nice.

7
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:27,986
And, uh, she set a date

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,904
for the wedding with Roy.

9
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,114
Uh, June.

10
00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:34,701
Summer, so that'll be nice.

11
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,453
And that's that.

12
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,124
- What?

13
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:44,419
- Oh, nothing.

14
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,004
- Jim's been looking at me

15
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,507
kind of a lot all week.

16
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,176
I would be creeped out by it,

17
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,510
but it's nothing compared

18
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,804
to the way Michael looks at me.

19
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,777
[upbeat piano music]

20
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:15,658
* *

21
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,101
- Spamster.

22
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,228
- Um...

23
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,355
Pam, plus Spam, plus--

24
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:46,856
- Hamster.
- Right.

25
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,233
- Welcome back.
How was your vacation?

26
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,609
- It was great.
- Yeah?

27
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,736
- Mm-hmm.
- Did you get lucky?

28
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,238
Oop! Boink.

29
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,408
- Roy and I just got back
from the Poconos.

30
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,368
I get ten vacation days a year.

31
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,245
And I try to hold off
taking them

32
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,080
for as long as possible.

33
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,082
And this year I got to

34
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,876
the third week in January.

35
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,545
- [as Sean Penn]
I am Pam.

36
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,171
Spicoli guy.

37
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,757
Oh, God.

38
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,259
Needs numbers. Okay.

39
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,345
Whoa, God! Yuck, yuck, yuck.

40
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:18,513
- What?
- Yuck! Wow!

41
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,848
What happened in there?

42
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,017
- I don't know.
- There is stink in there.

43
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,768
My God.

44
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,687
What is--what is that?

45
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,772
- Oh, I don't know.
- Is that a bird?

46
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,065
- No, I don't think
it's a bird.

47
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,608
- Oh, God.

48
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,278
How could that happen?
How could--

49
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,738
right in the middle
of the carpet.

50
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:36,865
- What's going on?
- Um, somebody vomited

51
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,117
right in the middle
of the carpet in my office.

52
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,952
- I don't think that's vomit.

53
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,953
- Check it out.

54
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,621
- Me?
- Check it out.

55
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,417
Don't be a wuss. Just get--

56
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,627
no, I'm not
holding your coffee.

57
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,713
Tell me what it is.
- Oh, that's a real bitch.

58
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:54,007
- What is it?

59
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:55,342
- Michael.
- What is it?

60
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,718
[knocking on door]
No, just tell me what it is.

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,678
- Michael, I--I--I gotta
get outta here.

62
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,556
I can't hold my breath
that long.

63
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:06,478
[knocking on door]

64
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,105
- Open the door up.
- [gasping]

65
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,274
[knocking on door]

66
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,901
- If he's not gonna
tell me what it is,

67
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:16,404
I'm gonna leave him in there.
- I don't know what it is!

68
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,823
- Oh, stop crying.

69
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,368
- It smelled terrible.

70
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:25,372
- [inhales deeply]

71
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,415
- Ugh!
- Phew!

72
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,751
- Oh, no. Mm-mm, mm-mm.

73
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:31,419
- [clears throat]
I cannot believe

74
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,046
a pipe burst
and left that there.

75
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:34,214
- That's no burst pipe.

76
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,091
- How do you know that?
What is it then?

77
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,093
- Maybe it's, um,
like, roadkill.

78
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,928
- There's a slight
discoloration

79
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:42,347
that runs throughout it.
- Maybe it was a flood

80
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,349
and then the water receded
and left--

81
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,475
- Or maybe it grew.

82
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:46,601
- What?
- Yes, with enough

83
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,228
light and water,
anything can grow.

84
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,146
- It didn't grow.
- Oh, man.

85
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,272
- Oh, it's really gross.

86
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,857
- Yeah, thank you,
Captain Obvious.

87
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,651
- That's odd.

88
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,527
From this angle,

89
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:56,945
it looks completely different.

90
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,029
- Hey, guys.

91
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,825
Somebody making soup?

92
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,202
- Here she comes.

93
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,913
All cleaned? Great.

94
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,709
- [gags]
Still stinky.

95
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,960
- That is worse.

96
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,003
- She probably scrubbed it

97
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,463
into the fibers of the carpet.

98
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,132
Total permeation.

99
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,134
- I am a big
"Fear Factor" fan.

100
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,011
Um, I'm a big fan of anything

101
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,013
Joe Rogan does, actually.

102
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,182
So this is sort of like
my audition tape.

103
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,643
Um... [clears throat]

104
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,729
[shudders]

105
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,938
I can't stand it.

106
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:37,485
I can't stay in here
another second.

107
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,987
[door closes]
- Hey.

108
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,572
Welcome back.
- Thanks.

109
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,323
- So how was the resort?

110
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,702
Did you ski a lot?
- A little.

111
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:48,079
- Good.
[loud bang]

112
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,875
What's going on in here?

113
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,126
What?

114
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:55,378
I did not do that.

115
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,089
That sounds disgusting.

116
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,133
- [laughing]
It wasn't me.

117
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:03,803
Um... it wasn't me.

118
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,097
It was not me.

119
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,600
Oh.

120
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,185
Wow.

121
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,729
- [chuckles]

122
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,108
- Hey, Jim, I thought

123
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,193
that we would be desk buddies

124
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,820
while they change my carpet.

125
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,113
That might be
a little difficult

126
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,865
with the one computer.

127
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,116
- Oh.

128
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,202
- But there's definitely
a desk open in the back.

129
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,330
- Yeah.

130
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:31,623
- Which I guess I'll be taking.

131
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,249
- No, no, no, seriously,
I don't mind sharing.

132
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,876
- No, no, no, seriously.

133
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,671
I'll be in the back.

134
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:43,301
Hey, Kelly.

135
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,386
- Are you moving
back here?

136
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,221
- Um, just for the day

137
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,722
while Michael's at my desk.

138
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,474
- Because Toby
used to sit there.

139
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:50,558
But then he had
to move over there

140
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,560
because of an allergy.

141
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,690
- Allergy to... the desk?

142
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,608
- Weird.

143
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,402
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

144
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,195
- [exhales]
- Ol' bullpen.

145
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,447
- [chuckles]
The ol' bullpen.

146
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,324
- Don't hate me.

147
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,325
- Okay.

148
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,993
- This is great.

149
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,203
- Yeah.

150
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,329
- The pressures of my office

151
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,455
are insane.
- Mm.

152
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,998
- I just--
you couldn't understand.

153
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,834
But, man, you guys have it
easy out here.

154
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,294
You know I used to sit
right here?

155
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,255
- No way.
- Yeah.

156
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:23,174
- And who had your office?

157
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,342
- Ed Truck.

158
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,635
Yuck.

159
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:28,096
Ed Truck was the manager
before me.

160
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:29,848
Horrible. He hated fun.

161
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,017
It was like, "Oh, Ed Truck
is walking toward us.

162
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,309
"Stop having fun.

163
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,687
Start pretending to do work."

164
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:38,064
What a jerk. He's--

165
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,524
you know what?

166
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,026
I swore to myself
that if I ever got

167
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,694
to walk around the room
as manager,

168
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,863
people would laugh
when they saw me coming

169
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:47,824
and would applaud
as I walked away.

170
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,909
- I'm serious, my closet doors

171
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,369
will not shut.

172
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,787
I mean, it only takes so long

173
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,789
to measure to make sure
that clothes will hang up.

174
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,708
'Cause aren't all hangers,
like, that big?

175
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,126
So I don't understand

176
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,711
why the closet engineer
didn't think of that.

177
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:01,504
So now,
I'm doing this new thing

178
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,548
where I just leave piles
of clothes on the floor.

179
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,134
And I walk around the piles
to get an outfit.

180
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,761
- You know who used
to sit at that desk?

181
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,763
- That guy Miles, who quit
to form his own company?

182
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,098
- Mm-mm. Todd Packer.

183
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,142
- No, I thought he was
out on the road.

184
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,519
He was, but, uh...

185
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,645
that desk was empty.

186
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,897
He'd come in and sit
there sometimes.

187
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,565
- Ah.

188
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:23,985
- When I was in training,

189
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:27,072
many years ago,
not so long ago,

190
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,448
I worked side by side

191
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,992
with a fellow
named Todd Packer.

192
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:34,079
And together,
we rocked the office.

193
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,748
[clattering]

194
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,125
Packer and I
once spent a whole day

195
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,794
with our pants off.

196
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,462
And when people noticed,
we convinced them

197
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:43,630
that they were crazy.

198
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:45,507
I would gladly pay you Tuesday

199
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,633
for a hamburger today.

200
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:48,593
- Excuse me one second,
please.

201
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,179
What is it that you need
right now that can't wait

202
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,181
until I'm off the phone
with a customer?

203
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,724
- Ooh, a customer.

204
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:57,102
Well, sound the alarm.

205
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,395
[laughs] Okay.

206
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,563
Another time,
Packer held this guy's head

207
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,065
in the toilet
for, like, a minute.

208
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,525
Guy had no sense
of humor about it.

209
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,151
Probably why he wasn't hired.

210
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,611
[grunts] Oh!

211
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,612
- What did you hit me for?

212
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:08,863
- Oh, Charlie horse.

213
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,448
- What?
- Charlie horse!

214
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,366
- You shouldn't have hit me,
Michael.

215
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,534
- Okay, gah.

216
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,202
Once, as a joke,

217
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,122
Packer banged
every chick in the office.

218
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,000
It was hysterical.

219
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,711
- That looks cool.
Where is that?

220
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,421
- What?
- That hotel?

221
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,507
It looks so romantic.

222
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,510
- Oh, uh, just somewhere
in the Poconos.

223
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:31,511
I was just surfing.

224
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,721
- I went with my parents

225
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,472
to the ShadowBrook Farm once.

226
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,266
That was also really romantic.

227
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:40,228
Oh, my God, I wish a boy
would take me there.

228
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,230
I would need a fun new top.

229
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,898
You know what
a great color is on me?

230
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,983
Lavender, actually.
- 'Scuse me one second.

231
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,985
I'm just gonna
grab something to eat.

232
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,493
Hey.
- Hey.

233
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,872
- So you used to share
that cubicle with Kelly, right?

234
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,331
- Mm-hmm.

235
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,084
- And then you just
changed desks, right?

236
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,295
- Yeah.

237
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,464
- To one without a cubicle.

238
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:10,050
- Yeah.
- Hm.

239
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,762
So you just couldn't
take it anymore, huh?

240
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:17,891
- What are you talking about?

241
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,352
- So that's how it's gonna be.

242
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,062
- [quietly] Yeah.

243
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,730
Honestly,

244
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,690
I don't even hear her anymore.

245
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,610
It's like waves crashing
against the beach.

246
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,195
- Beyoncé,

247
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,738
pink, the color,

248
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,073
Pink, the person,

249
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,074
hot dogs,

250
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,368
basically anything
that is awesome,

251
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,952
snow cones--
- Hey, Jim.

252
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,537
Michael wanted me to ask you

253
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,706
how to raise your desk chair.

254
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,667
- It's the lever on the side.

255
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,918
- That's what I told him.

256
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,252
Thanks.

257
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:54,302
- Oh, my God, he is so cute.

258
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,428
Would you talk to him for me

259
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:58,056
and see if he likes me?

260
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,307
- Oh, no, I don't think I can--

261
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,768
- Oh, please, Jim.
Please, please, Jim.

262
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,478
Please, please, please?
He's so cute.

263
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,854
I like him so much.

264
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,147
And I would do it,
but I'm too shy.

265
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,900
Please, Jim?
Please, please, please?

266
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,903
Please, Jim, please?
Please, please?

267
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,405
- [whispers]
Dwight.

268
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,031
- [whispers]
Michael.

269
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:18,201
- Let's send up accounting.

270
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,911
- What?
- Old-fashioned raid.

271
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,246
Sales on accounting.

272
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,414
- [laughs softly]

273
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,332
- Follow my lead.

274
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,878
Hey, guys.
- Hey, Michael.

275
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,338
- What's up?
- Hey, Dwight.

276
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:36,720
[both screaming and laughing]

277
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:39,806
- Whoo-hoo!

278
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,141
- Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

279
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,059
Woo!

280
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,146
- Ah! Ah!
- Sales rules!

281
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,273
Yeah, yeah!

282
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,984
[laughs]

283
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,152
- Should we help 'em
pick up their stuff?

284
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,778
- No, no, no, no.
We don't do that.

285
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,779
We don't do that.
- Oh, okay.

286
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:55,822
Watch out, Pam.

287
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,115
You're next.

288
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,408
- You're gonna throw
my things on the ground?

289
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:00,869
- Maybe.

290
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,163
- What happened
in Michael's office was wrong.

291
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,164
I understand it.

292
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,123
It makes sense.

293
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,626
[laughs]

294
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,962
But it's--but it was
still wrong.

295
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,840
- Obviously, this was Kevin.

296
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:16,885
This is his sense of humor
exactly.

297
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,220
- There are so many people
with motives.

298
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,139
Even me.

299
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,517
Almost everyone is a suspect.

300
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,019
[chuckles]

301
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:30,231
Whoever did this is a genius.
[laughs]

302
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,858
- I can't imagine
anybody in the office

303
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,321
hates Michael that much.

304
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,864
Well, maybe.

305
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,533
- I think this whole disaster
on Michael's carpet

306
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,744
happened for a good reason.

307
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,538
Him sitting next to me
is a huge gift.

308
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,915
This girl I know

309
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,333
would say that it
was a gift from God,

310
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,002
but I don't know
about all that.

311
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,671
Why would somebody ruin

312
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,632
a perfectly good carpet?

313
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:59,386
I don't know.

314
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,428
Could be done out of hate.

315
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,515
Could be done out of love.

316
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,184
It could be completely neutral.

317
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,186
Maybe somebody hates
the cleaning lady.

318
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,939
And, well, she doesn't do
a very good job, obviously.

319
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,692
because my office still reeks

320
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,444
like you would not believe.

321
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,405
I hate her. [scoffs]

322
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,369
- You know what?
I am beginning to think

323
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,247
that what happened to my carpet

324
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,625
was an act of terrorism
against the office.

325
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,377
The only thing
that makes any sense.

326
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:37,841
- Hello,
am I the 107th caller?

327
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,883
Hello, Rock 107,

328
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:44,055
am I the 107th caller?

329
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:48,226
Hello, Rock 107,
am I the 107th caller?

330
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,644
I'm totally gonna win us
that box set.

331
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:50,520
- Stop.

332
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:53,314
- Jethro Tull--
- Stop it.

333
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,737
Stop. It.

334
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,905
Don't.

335
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,365
Don't.

336
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:06,453
- I need to make
a sales call.

337
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,454
Please?

338
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,456
- All right.

339
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,676
- [whispering]
Am I the 107th caller?

340
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,136
- [quietly] That's so smart.

341
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:24,304
- [quietly]
Leave it all packed.

342
00:13:24,346 --> 00:13:25,638
We can go in a
couple of weeks, maybe.

343
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,641
- Yeah, right.
- Okay, maybe not.

344
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,769
- Like, maybe for, like,
President's Day or something.

345
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,770
- Yeah, that's right.

346
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,313
We could do
a three-day weekend.

347
00:13:33,355 --> 00:13:35,523
I wonder if I could, like,
call in sick on Friday.

348
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,693
And then get
a four-day weekend.

349
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,320
[laughs]

350
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:43,198
- It's so hard to fall asleep.
And I just hate it, cause I try

351
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,157
to go to bed at, like,
9:30 every night.

352
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,200
- Are you kidding?
- No.

353
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,451
- Hi, guys.

354
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:47,786
- We haven't finished
getting things

355
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,037
in order from your last visit.

356
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,288
- I'm just walking around.

357
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,831
- Were you?
- Well, yeah.

358
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,500
- It's just that we're really
swamped over here, Michael.

359
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,835
- Oh, and I'm not?
Why would you say that?

360
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,128
Because I'm having fun?

361
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,005
You guys just are

362
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:00,256
working for the weekend,
aren't you?

363
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:01,841
I'm working for the week.

364
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:03,843
Sales team.

365
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:04,928
Listen to me.

366
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,846
This is what we're gonna do.

367
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,474
I'm gonna up the ante
a little bit, literally.

368
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,976
Right here, I'm going
to put a crisp $100 bill.

369
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,269
The person with the most sales

370
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,896
at the end of the day
gets to keep the cash.

371
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,606
Sound good?
- Yeah!

372
00:14:16,648 --> 00:14:19,275
- 70, 80, 1, 2, 3.

373
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,028
$83. Still a lot of money.

374
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,406
And I'm going to...

375
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,033
I'm gonna leave it
right over here

376
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,536
where everybody can see it.

377
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:32,831
I will be taking
Jim's clients today

378
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,124
because he is not here.

379
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,751
And out of sight,
out of the contest.

380
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,045
Let's see who winds up
with the cash, shall we?

381
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,380
- You're gonna compete
against us?

382
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:42,298
- Oh, it is on, Phyllis!
It is so on!

383
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,383
- It is so on!

384
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:46,511
- God, this is gonna be fun.

385
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:49,139
- Michael is gonna
wipe the floor with us.

386
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:13,121
- So you have 40 boxes
going out.

387
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,665
And I will deliver those
personally in a Sebring.

388
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,500
Very good.
Nice doing business with you.

389
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,877
Thank you.

390
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,795
Yes!

391
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,339
[chuckles] Yeah.

392
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,341
Read it and weep.

393
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,343
Oh. Ooh, look at that.

394
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,345
Look at me, Phyllis.
Oh, what is that?

395
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,637
That's my sale.

396
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,016
[humming tune]

397
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:37,437
[vocalizing]

398
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,730
- What--what's that?
What you doing?

399
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:40,273
- Nothing.
- I think he's dancing.

400
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,483
- No, just--

401
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,817
- That was definitely
not dancing.

402
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,444
- You know what, guys?
It's none of your concern.

403
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:46,279
It was official business,
so just--

404
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,822
- Paper business.
- Yeah, paper business.

405
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,991
Is this done?
- No.

406
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:51,284
"Extreme Home Makeover"

407
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,786
puts together a house
in an hour.

408
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:53,787
If you were on that crew,

409
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:56,122
you'd be fired like that.

410
00:15:56,164 --> 00:15:57,290
- Somebody did something bad

411
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:00,293
to Michael's carpet.

412
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,963
Maybe that's all
we need to know.

413
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,256
[thumping]

414
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:07,133
- [chuckling]

415
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,387
- Ah!

416
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:13,973
- You gotta drink.
I'm not letting you get back.

417
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,893
You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

418
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,311
[thumping]
- Uh-huh,

419
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,230
now you got to drink.
- Ah.

420
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:22,774
- All right, three boxes.
Excellent.

421
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,276
Oh, hey, I can't offer you
a discount right now,

422
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:26,444
but for the same low price,

423
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,737
you could put in
next month's order

424
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,406
right now as well.

425
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:33,284
Okay, six it is. Fantastic.

426
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,537
Good. No, thank you.

427
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,706
Bye-bye.

428
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,641
- Okay, that quantity
of cotton fiber

429
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,935
will cost you...

430
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:01,396
my screen disappeared.

431
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:04,524
I know.
Uh, I will click on the bottom

432
00:17:04,566 --> 00:17:07,986
and, yes, I'm getting
one of those

433
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:09,863
little hourglass things.

434
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:11,281
Used to have a price chart
on the wall.

435
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:13,033
Now it's a little
hourglass thing with a

436
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,367
arrow next to it.

437
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,453
Now it's just an hourglass
thing.

438
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,873
Uh-huh, yeah, well,
or I can call you back.

439
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:23,877
Okay.

440
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,253
- Excellent, good, good.

441
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,671
Well, our truck is going out

442
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,882
first thing
tomorrow morning, so...

443
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:32,469
- 45 cases of technical format
coded white paper.

444
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,054
Okay, thanks again so much.

445
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,347
All righty, buh-bye.

446
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,890
- 20 cartons of it's coming.
On its way.

447
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,391
- What's going on?
Anything here?

448
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,726
- Yes.
- Yes?

449
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:42,228
Yes, what?
Yes, a sale or a lead or--

450
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,855
- A sale.
- Ah.

451
00:17:43,897 --> 00:17:45,398
Small?
- Big.

452
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,942
- Huge?
- Just big.

453
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,694
- Would you say the sale
that I made earlier,

454
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:53,281
it was huge or--
- Big.

455
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,205
- Good, no,
I completely understand.

456
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,581
Times are a little tight
right now.

457
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:02,874
If it's all right
with you, though,

458
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,085
I will just give you
a call back next month.

459
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,169
Great.

460
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,089
Thank youso much. Goodbye.

461
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,382
- What was that?

462
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:11,758
- What?
- You call that a sales call?

463
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,510
My God, what have
they been teaching you?

464
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:14,761
- You're the one
who trained me, Michael.

465
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:15,929
- Yeah, well, did I teach you

466
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,515
to roll over
like a submissive dog?

467
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:20,600
- You most certainly did not.
- No, I did not.

468
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:23,019
- What can I do better?
- Exactly, ask me.

469
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:25,772
which you did, so--

470
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,273
tell a joke.

471
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,274
- I'm not good at jokes.

472
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,734
- Do you know a joke?

473
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:30,902
- My cousin Mose
told me a joke.

474
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:32,278
- Call a client right now.
- Okay.

475
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,363
- And tell them the joke.

476
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,074
- I will.

477
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,450
- Strike while the iron's hot.

478
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:38,952
The joke always works.

479
00:18:38,993 --> 00:18:41,871
- Yes, Howard Gruber, please.
- Just sell it.

480
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:45,417
- Howard, hello.
Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.

481
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,627
Yes, and you are
my favorite client.

482
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,462
[chuckles]
Listen, I'm calling you

483
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:51,006
to tell you a little joke.

484
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:55,385
What is black and white
and red and can't think?

485
00:18:55,427 --> 00:18:57,470
A nun who has
a beet for a head.

486
00:18:57,512 --> 00:19:01,016
[uncomfortable laughter]

487
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:02,142
No, I--I'm Catholic, too.

488
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,435
- Give me the phone.

489
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,644
- I understand.
- Give me the phone.

490
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:06,062
- If I was offensive
in any way--

491
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:07,897
- Tell them that your
supervisor is on the line.

492
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,858
- Humor is--works in--
- The old one-two.

493
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:12,402
- crazy ways. I'm gonna pass
you off to my supervisor.

494
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:14,029
Hold on one second.

495
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,072
Howard Gruber, it's Howard.
- Hey, Howard.

496
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,449
Michael Scott here.

497
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,450
Yeah, sorry about that.

498
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,743
Dwight is an idiot.

499
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,786
I know. No, he's a little...

500
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:22,829
little dim.

501
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:25,165
He's the janitor's brother,
so...

502
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,791
- That's not true.

503
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:27,751
- Uh-huh.

504
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,044
Yeah, well, you know, like,

505
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,004
at a fast food restaurant,

506
00:19:31,046 --> 00:19:32,547
just to be nice,
you'll hire somebody

507
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,299
who can't even find
their way to work?

508
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,633
That is Dwight.

509
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,177
- [whispers]
He's my best customer!

510
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,929
- What can we do
to help you out?

511
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,765
You know what?
I have a discount,

512
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:44,559
today and today only,
on lightweight copier paper.

513
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:45,560
- No, that's my sale.

514
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,103
This is--this is my sale!

515
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,396
Michael!
- Uh-huh.

516
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,522
Yes, I can do that.

517
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:51,191
Absolutely!

518
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,735
Perfect. Oh, I'm glad
it timed out that way.

519
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,070
- What Michael
doesn't understand

520
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,530
is that when I worked
in the fast food industry,

521
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,657
I was actually commended
by management

522
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,534
for the three M's.

523
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:02,952
McService,

524
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,120
McCompetence,

525
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,414
and McPunctuality.

526
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,707
- Who do you think did it?

527
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,376
- Are you kidding?
I thought it was you.

528
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,960
- Really? I thought you.

529
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:15,590
[both chuckle]

530
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:21,721
- This was no act of God.
A person did this.

531
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:24,099
A person who works
in this office.

532
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,601
Maybe all of them.

533
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,269
You know what?

534
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:31,064
Today is not a good day

535
00:20:31,106 --> 00:20:32,023
for a sales contest.

536
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:34,150
We're--we're not
doing this today.

537
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,360
- That doesn't seem fair.

538
00:20:35,402 --> 00:20:36,861
- You want to talk
about fair?

539
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,572
Does anyone need to smell
my old carpet?

540
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,032
You explain to me
how that was fair,

541
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:42,867
and I'll explain to you
how this is fair.

542
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,578
Plus I just--I think
that picking today

543
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,705
was sort of taking advantage.

544
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:47,872
- But you're the one
who picked today.

545
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:51,751
- I am a victim
of a hate crime.

546
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:53,294
Stanley knows
what I'm talking about.

547
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,046
- That's not what
a hate crime is.

548
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,507
- Well, I hated it
a lot, okay?

549
00:20:57,549 --> 00:20:59,592
I-- You know what?

550
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:02,095
If the guilty person
would just come forward

551
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,180
and take their punishment,
we'd be done.

552
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,645
Very well.

553
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,022
Then you're all punished.

554
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,231
- What's our punishment?

555
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,692
- You're all on a time-out.

556
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:19,696
Just sit there quietly.

557
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:21,156
[phone ringing]

558
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,199
No, no.

559
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,493
[phone ringing]

560
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,708
- Hey.

561
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,085
- What's up?
- Nothing much.

562
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,628
Let me ask you something.

563
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,380
It's actually a little awkward.

564
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:38,673
- What?

565
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,968
- What do you think of Kelly?

566
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,219
- I don't know.

567
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:46,097
Depends if you like
a little junk in...

568
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,641
um, she's really cool.

569
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:49,934
- Are you interested in her?

570
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,186
- Yeah, totally.

571
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,146
- Really?
- Did she say something?

572
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,065
- She said lots of things.

573
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,816
- Do you know
if she's looking for

574
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:57,984
a long-term thing

575
00:21:58,026 --> 00:22:01,821
or if she'd be cool
just hanging out?

576
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:03,531
- I have no idea.

577
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:06,284
- Could you find out?

578
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,869
- Yeah.

579
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,663
Sure.

580
00:22:10,705 --> 00:22:12,457
- I don't know much
about Kelly.

581
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:15,085
But why not? Try it out.

582
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,003
It's not like I'm gonna
be here that long.

583
00:22:17,045 --> 00:22:19,464
And she's really cute.

584
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:20,548
Right?

585
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,509
- Oh, long-term, definitely.

586
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,594
Fall in love, have babies,

587
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:26,137
spend every second together.

588
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,430
But don't tell him that, okay?

589
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,516
Just tell him
I'm, like, up for anything.

590
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,768
I mean, I'm not a slut,
but who knows?

591
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,478
- Do you remember Ed Truck?

592
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,896
- Sure, he hired me.

593
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:36,606
How's he doing?

594
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:37,857
- How would I know?

595
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:39,776
- I thought you might.

596
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:41,611
- My biggest fear is
turning into him.

597
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,905
- Michael, you should have
much bigger fears than that.

598
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:44,989
- [sighs]

599
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,117
I wasn't talking
literally, Creed.

600
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,952
Yeah, being buried alive
would be worse.

601
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,579
Happy? Why am I talking to you?

602
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:52,664
Ed?

603
00:22:52,706 --> 00:22:55,625
Hi, thanks for meeting me.

604
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:57,919
Must be kinda neat coming back.

605
00:22:57,961 --> 00:22:59,587
- Yeah. Shall we go upstairs?

606
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,256
- Uh, well, honestly, Ed,

607
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:03,800
I really don't want
to be up there right now.

608
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:05,760
- So what's the problem
with my pension?

609
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,345
- Oh, no, no, no.

610
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,264
You're good, it was clerical.
You're good.

611
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:15,603
Um, what does that
smell like to you?

612
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:16,646
- I have a cold.

613
00:23:16,688 --> 00:23:18,231
- For God's sake.

614
00:23:18,273 --> 00:23:19,357
- What does that
smell like to you?

615
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,525
- Well, somebody

616
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:21,735
did something in my office,

617
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,737
and I now think that
they did it on purpose

618
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:24,946
and it was directed at me.

619
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:27,157
- But what was done?
- I don't know.

620
00:23:27,198 --> 00:23:29,951
I didn't get a good look at it.

621
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:32,454
But it smells horrible.

622
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:33,830
- Whoa. [sniffs]

623
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:35,999
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

624
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,001
- Yeah, somebody once

625
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:40,170
did that in my office.
- Really?

626
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,671
- Yeah.
- Well, that figures.

627
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:44,591
So how did you deal with

628
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:45,675
people not liking you?

629
00:23:45,717 --> 00:23:47,677
- Well, some people liked me.

630
00:23:47,719 --> 00:23:48,678
- Can I be frank?

631
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,888
- You should say that

632
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:51,681
before you speak frankly.

633
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:53,350
- You had no idea

634
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,977
that people hated you so much?

635
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,145
That amazes me.

636
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:58,938
- I was their boss.

637
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,648
- Yeah, well--
- Now you're their boss.

638
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,735
You can't expect to be
friends with everybody.

639
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:05,236
- Well, sure I can.

640
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,030
- No.
They'll always think of you

641
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,699
as a boss first.
- Not necessarily.

642
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:12,118
You can love a boss
like you do a father.

643
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,495
- I'm not sure
that ever happens.

644
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:14,788
- Well, okay.

645
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,040
Different management styles.

646
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:19,417
- Why can't your workers
be your workers,

647
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,378
family be your family,
your friends be your friends?

648
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,672
- Okay, yeah,
sounds like a good idea.

649
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:26,132
- The best thing you can do
for your workers

650
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:28,343
is give them a strong,
stable company to work at.

651
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:29,719
- Ah.
- That's what helps them

652
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,763
with their real friends

653
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:34,516
and their real family.

654
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,017
- Last week,
I would've given a kidney

655
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,103
to anyone in this office.

656
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,562
I would've reached

657
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:41,439
right into my stomach
and pulled it out for them.

658
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:43,066
But now, no.

659
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,401
I don't have the relationship

660
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,528
with these people
that I thought I did.

661
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,613
I hope they ask.

662
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,615
So they can hear me say,

663
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,242
"Uh, no.

664
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,911
"I only give my organs
to my real friends.

665
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,914
Go get yourself
a monkey kidney."

666
00:24:57,956 --> 00:24:59,874
- Hey, Brenda, this is,

667
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,585
uh, Jim Halpert from the boat.

668
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:05,422
And I got your number
from the corporate directory.

669
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:07,841
And, well,
I was assuming that you

670
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:08,967
probably gave it
to them because

671
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:11,636
you wanted me
to ask you out, right?

672
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:15,140
Um, so give me a call back.

673
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,726
You can get my number
from said directory,

674
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,687
um, or just check your email

675
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:23,940
cause I just sent you one.

676
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:26,609
Yikes.
Uh, give me a call back...

677
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:27,694
I hope.

678
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:32,699
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

679
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:37,620
- You just asked a girl out
on the phone.

680
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,372
- Yup.

681
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,627
- Okay, look, I know
what you're gonna say.

682
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,296
That I'm not standing up
for myself.

683
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:47,630
But you know what?
It's complicated

684
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:52,052
and I really don't appreciate
all the badgering.

685
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:56,097
- You could out-sell Michael
any day.

686
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:03,104
[phone rings]

687
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:04,647
- Yes.

688
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:07,192
- Hello, yes,
I'm looking for a gay nerd

689
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,152
named Michael Scott.
- Who is this?

690
00:26:09,194 --> 00:26:10,987
How did you get this number?

691
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,947
- Your mom, you gay nerd.

692
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:14,240
- Oh, my God.

693
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,326
Packer. Packster!

694
00:26:16,368 --> 00:26:18,161
Wacky Pack, how you doing?

695
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:19,704
- Hey, listen, did you
get that package

696
00:26:19,746 --> 00:26:21,122
I left for you?

697
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:23,375
- Uh, no.

698
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:26,044
Did anybody see
a package here today?

699
00:26:26,086 --> 00:26:27,420
No, how big was it?

700
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:28,922
- It was pretty big.

701
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:30,173
- Really?
- Yeah.

702
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,133
- You see a big package?

703
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:33,385
Where did you leave it?

704
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:35,387
- Left it in the middle
of your office.

705
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:36,930
- Really? Guys, did you see

706
00:26:36,971 --> 00:26:39,933
a big package in my office?

707
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:40,892
- You mean the thing?

708
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:45,397
- [laughing]

709
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:48,066
- Are you kidding me?

710
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:49,651
Oh.

711
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:51,152
- Special delivery.
- That was Packer!

712
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:53,780
Oh, you're--oh, you are dead.

713
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:55,740
You are dead, my friend.

714
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:58,368
That is hilar--Oh, God!

715
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,412
Of course it was you.

716
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:05,208
- Sit on the throne, Michael.
- Oh, yeah, yeah!

717
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:08,044
Oh, my God, it was Packer.

718
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:09,546
It takes
an advanced sense of humor.

719
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,798
I don't expect everybody
to understand.

720
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,509
It was done out of love
just like I thought.

721
00:27:14,551 --> 00:27:17,220
It's, uh, God,
these people are so--

722
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:19,389
these are good people.

723
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:22,851
We have fun. We just have fun.

724
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:26,104
Oh, I'm just so sorry
that I threw the thing out.

725
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:32,902
- We're all done.
- Yes, my office!

726
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:35,739
See ya later, peasants.

727
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,365
- [sighs]

728
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:41,745
What was that look?

729
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:43,413
- I didn't give a look.

730
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:45,749
What was your look?

731
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,834
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

732
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:49,461
- We should've guessed Packer.

733
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,795
- I still thought you did it.

734
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:52,005
Even after you denied it.

735
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:54,632
- I still thought it was you.
- [chuckles]

736
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:03,516
- You have seven
unheard messages.

737
00:28:03,558 --> 00:28:05,602
[beep]
- Hey, Jim, it's Pam.

738
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:07,270
I keep looking up
to say something to you,

739
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:09,439
and then Michael's there
and it's horrible.

740
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:10,982
Anyway, I'm bored.

741
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,192
Come back.

742
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:13,777
[beep]
Hey, guess what?

743
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:16,446
I moved my computer
so I can't see Michael's head.

744
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:17,781
It's working.
I think I can have a career

745
00:28:17,822 --> 00:28:19,866
as a very specific type
of decorator.

746
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,326
[beep]
Sudoku.

747
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:23,578
Level, moderate.
Time, 18 minutes.

748
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,039
Suck on that, Halpert.

749
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:28,124
[beep]
I'll transfer you.

750
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,959
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

751
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,753
Hold, please.

752
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:33,505
Dunder Mifflin, this is--
Okay, sorry.

753
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:34,798
Michael was standing
at my desk

754
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,174
and I needed to be busy
or who knows what

755
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:37,634
would've happened,
so thank you.

756
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:39,219
[beep]
Hey, what's that word

757
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,220
we made up for when you have

758
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:41,888
a thing stuck in your shoe?

759
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,474
Anyway, I have a thing
stuck in my shoe.

760
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:45,684
[beep]
Hey, I have a chance

761
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:47,060
to sneak out of here early,

762
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:48,061
and I'm not messing this up,

763
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,396
so I'll see you tomorrow.

764
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:51,606
[beep]
Calling from my cell phone.

765
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:52,857
I don't know
if you guys figured out

766
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:54,484
who did that
to Michael's carpet yet,

767
00:28:54,526 --> 00:28:55,902
but I have a theory
that involves

768
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:58,154
an interdepartmental
conspiracy--

769
00:28:58,196 --> 00:28:59,906
everybody in the office.

770
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:01,658
We need to talk.

1
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,264
- Nothing much.
What's up with you?

2
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,598
- I cannot believe
I feel for that.

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,600
[laughs]
Gosh.

4
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,477
- Ha ha.
What?

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:21,813
What?
Where's the funny?

6
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,606
Give it to me.

7
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:27,819
- Um, is it me, or does it
smell like updog in here?

8
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,029
- What's updog?

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,363
- Nothing much.
What's up with you?

10
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,992
- Oh, wow.

11
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,661
[laughs]
I walked right into that.

12
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,122
Oh, that's brilliant.

13
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,291
Hey, Stanley.
Is that jacket made of updog?

14
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,292
- I'm on the phone.

15
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,419
[indistinct chatter]

16
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,547
- Mm!

17
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,632
What flavor coffee
is that, updog?

18
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,800
- What's that?

19
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:51,801
- I don't know.
Nothing.

20
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:52,719
What's up with you?

21
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:54,929
- Huh?
- No.

22
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,139
Damn it.

23
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,766
- What does that mean?

24
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,018
- What does what mean?
- That thing you just said.

25
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,728
- Just forget it.

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,605
Dwight.

27
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,647
Hey, is it me,

28
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,983
or does this place
smell like updog?

29
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,860
- What's updog?
- Gotcha!

30
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,529
[laughs]
Oh, God!

31
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,073
Crap.

32
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,911
Nothing.
How are you doing?

33
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,246
- Good.
How are you doing?

34
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,248
- Mm, I can't.

35
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,337
[sighs]
Damn it.

36
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:30,298
[upbeat music]

- [whistling melody]

40
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,045
- Really, just the two?
You think that'll be enough?

41
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,422
- No, I don't.

42
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:14,551
[whistling melody]

43
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,726
- Smart.

44
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,731
- [whistling melody]
Spring cleaning!

00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,692
[whistling melody]

46
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,823
- Sad.
- What?

47
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,284
- Smart.
- Yeah.

48
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,500
- Today is spring cleaning day
here at Dunder Mifflin,

49
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,295
and, yes, I know it's January.
I am not an idiot.

50
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,380
But if you do
your spring cleaning

51
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,007
in January, guess what
you don't have to do

52
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:54,966
in the spring.

53
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,344
Anything.

54
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,721
They say a cluttered desk
means a cluttered mind.

55
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,932
Well, I say
an empty desk means an--

56
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,142
- Empty mind.
- No.

57
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,310
That's not--no.

58
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,270
That's not
what I was gonna say.

59
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,521
Look at 'em all out there.

60
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,231
My little worker bees
buzzing away.

61
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,277
- If they're the worker bees,
you're the queen bee.

62
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,238
- No, I am the king bee.

63
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,699
- Queen's higher.
- No, king is higher.

64
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,700
Then ace.

65
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,496
I am the ace bee.

66
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,540
- Meredith, men's room.

67
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,834
Make sure you replace
the urinal cakes.

68
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,877
They're worn down.

69
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,254
Kevin, file drawers.

70
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,799
Angela, kitchen.

71
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,343
Oscar, dusting.
Where is Oscar?

72
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,636
- He's out sick.

73
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,721
- That is unacceptable.

74
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,890
- I agree.
It's unacceptable.

75
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,272
- What are you guys doing?

76
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:56,194
- "People" magazine
crossword puzzle,

77
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,154
keep or toss?

78
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,281
- Keep.
I will finish that later.

79
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,950
- It's from '99.

80
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,576
- Yeah, I know
when it's from, Ryan.

81
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:11,292
- 18 across--
Mary-Kate and Ashley blank.

82
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:15,463
Michael wrote, "Judd?"

83
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,923
- Michael.
- Yes.

84
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,720
[whispers]
Oscar is out sick.

85
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,514
- On a Friday?

86
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,351
Sick on a Friday.
Starting the weekend early.

87
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,520
Homey, don't play that.

88
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:33,440
Man, this is a huge problem
in offices everywhere.

89
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:36,901
I looked this up,
and it turns out

90
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,404
that two
out of every five sick days

91
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:42,115
are taken on a Friday
or a Monday.

92
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,450
Think about that.

93
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,370
[dialing]

94
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,122
[line trilling]

95
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,790
- Can I do some of the talking?
- I will do the talking.

96
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,292
- Okay, let him know
that I'm here though.

97
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,752
- Hello?

98
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,045
- What difference does it make
whether you're here?

99
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,129
- Hello?

100
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:57,797
- Hi, Oscar.
It's Michael.

101
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,090
- And Dwight.

102
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,468
- Yeah, um, heard you
were under the weather.

103
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,261
- Yeah, I think
I came down with the flu.

104
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,764
- Really?
Oh, that is a shame.

105
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,974
You know,
it's cleaning day here today.

106
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,643
Could've used some of that
famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.

107
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,395
- Yeah, I feel terrible
about it.

108
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,272
- Ask him his symptoms.
I'm on WebMD.

109
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,899
- What are your symptoms?

110
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,901
- I have the chills...
- Mm-hmm.

111
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,694
- I'm feeling nauseous,
and my head's killing.

112
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,115
- [sighs]
Checks out.

113
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,076
- Michael, is there anything
you need from me?

114
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,452
I'd like to go back to bed.

115
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,621
- I need you to go to bed.
I need you to get better.

116
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,581
See you Monday
unless you're still sick.

117
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,041
So have a great long weekend.

118
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,334
- I'll just be sleep--

119
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,089
- Okay, first impressions.
- He sounded sick.

120
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,715
- Which is exactly
how you'd want to sound

121
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,925
if you wanted someone
to think you were sick.

122
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,510
- That's exactly
what I was thinking.

123
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,637
- Question, may I investigate?

124
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,389
- Yeah, drop what you're doing.

125
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,642
Make this a priority
because an office

126
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,936
can't function efficiently
unless people

127
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,647
are at their desks
doing their jobs.

128
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,023
- I bought my veil.
- Oh, my God.

129
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,235
That is so exciting.
Can I be a bridesmaid?

130
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,945
- Um...

131
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,488
- Listen,
you don't have to answer now,

132
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,781
but how are you
gonna do your hair?

133
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:08,118
- Okay, I was thinking
about wearing it down

134
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:12,664
kind of, like, I don't know.
Like, loose with big curls.

135
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,708
- You look like an angel.
I'm seriously gonna cry.

136
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:18,253
- Wowie.
Mikey likey.

137
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,005
Why don't you wear your hair
like that all the time?

138
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:20,964
It's much sexier.

139
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,342
[sighs]

140
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,386
Man, this must be
torture for you.

141
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,931
- Yeah, on the booze cruise,

142
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,350
I told Michael
about some feelings

143
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,519
I used to have for Pam.

144
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,396
I had just broken up
with Katie

145
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,523
and had a couple of drinks,

146
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:42,152
and I confided
in the world's worst confidant.

147
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,909
Hey, Mike.
- Hey, Jim bag.

148
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,704
- Remember that thing
I told you

149
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,330
on the booze cruise about Pam?

150
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,042
That was personal,

151
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,294
so if we could just keep
that between you and me,

152
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,795
that would be great.
- Really?

153
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,714
- Mm-hmm.
- Who else knows?

154
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,758
- Nobody.
- Wow.

155
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,552
Jim and I are great friends.

156
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:11,056
We hang out a ton--
mostly at work.

157
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,850
But the fact that he told me
his secret and no one else

158
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:16,561
says everything
about our friendship,

159
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,522
and it is why I intend
on keeping that secret

160
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,649
for as long as I possibly can.

161
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,861
My lips are sealed.
* My lips are sealed *

162
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:26,571
Bangles.
- All right, great.

163
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,864
Thank you.

164
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,699
- * Can you hear me? *

165
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,743
* They talk about us *

166
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,912
* Telling lies *

167
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:38,416
- Listen, temp, I am conducting
a little investigation,

168
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,836
so I am no longer gonna be able
to head up spring cleaning.

169
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,713
Do you think you
can handle it?

170
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:44,756
- Yeah, I think
I can handle it.

171
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:48,343
- Do you think or do you know?

172
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,678
- I think.

173
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,849
- Oh, God.
Here.

174
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,520
- Don't be fooled
by the phrase "dust bunnies."

175
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,689
They are
vicious, little bitches,

176
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,941
and if they get inside
your disc drive, God help you.

177
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,276
They will bring your computer
to its knees.

178
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,070
They sit in corners

179
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,115
hatching,
defecating, laying eggs,

180
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,951
and their sole purpose in life
is to eat dead skin,

181
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,161
which humans in this office
shed by the boatload.

182
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,498
Especially Creed.

183
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,794
- Hey, what you getting?
- I'm going with grape.

184
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,547
Ah, good stuff.
Good stuff.

185
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:26,965
- Yup.

186
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,342
- See the game last night?
- Which game?

187
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,094
- Any of 'em.

188
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:35,890
So, uh, what's the 4-1-1?

189
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,309
Any updates
on the "P" situation?

190
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,644
- I don't know what you mean.

191
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:40,729
- P-A-M.
- Yeah, no.

192
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,730
- P-A...
- Oh.

193
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,856
- M.
- Okay.

194
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,274
- No, it's okay.
We're talking code.

195
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,442
- What?
What is?

196
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,860
- Listen, Stan--you know,

197
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,445
how long does it take
for you to pick out a soda?

198
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,487
- I'm gonna take off actually.

199
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,447
- All right, well...
- Yep.

200
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,865
- Cool.

201
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,036
Still deciding?
- Hm?

202
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,539
- Peach iced tea.

203
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,834
You're gonna hate it.

204
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,628
- Hey, Oscar, how you doing?
Dwight Schrute calling.

205
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,339
Listen, little question
for you, buddy.

206
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,717
I called six minutes ago,
and no one answered,

207
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,218
so I was wondering
if you could expl--

208
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,013
Oh, I see.

209
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:18,141
So sounds like you're too sick
to come into work,

210
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:20,435
but you're well enough
to go to the pharmacy.

211
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,561
There are several
different ways

212
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,521
to tell if a perp is lying.

213
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,067
The liar
will avoid direct eye contact.

214
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:31,196
The liar will cover part of
his or her face with his hand,

215
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,155
especially the mouth.

216
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,908
The liar will perspire.

217
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,953
Unfortunately, I spoke
to Oscar on the phone,

218
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,747
so none of this is useful.

219
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,963
- It's grrrape...soda.

220
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,590
- Tony the Tiger.
- Yeah.

221
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,633
- You don't hear that
much anymore.

222
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,717
- Not so much.

223
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,928
- Okay,
what is going on here?

224
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,764
- Nothing.
- Oh, really, nothing?

225
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,015
Fact,
you are drinking grape soda.

226
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,475
You never drink grape soda.

227
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,812
Fact, you are talking to Jim.
You never talk to Jim.

228
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,231
- Fact, I love grape soda.
I always have.

229
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,483
Fact, Jim and I talk
all the time.

230
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:10,610
We tell each other secrets.

231
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,195
- Okay, so what is the secret,
Michael?

232
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,197
- Um, I had asked Michael

233
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,199
if I could head up
the Oscar investigation,

234
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:20,328
and he said that only Dwight
was capable of handling

235
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,247
such sensitive material.

236
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,375
- Is that true?

237
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,212
- Um...

238
00:10:29,254 --> 00:10:30,755
I--I don't know.

239
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,592
Uh...yeah, yeah, it is.

240
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,636
- Thank you, Michael.

241
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,346
I know
you're telling the truth.

242
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,223
- Okay.
- I can tell.

243
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:41,933
I won't let you down.

244
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,102
- Good.
- Thanks.

245
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,357
- [exhales deeply]
Nice, that was--that was slick.

246
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:51,109
What're you doing for lunch?
- I don't know.

247
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,569
I'm probably just gonna eat
my ham and cheese sandwich

248
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,070
in the break room.
- Oh, nonsense.

249
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,447
No way, no.

250
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,032
Why don't, uh...

251
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:57,949
why don't I take you
out to lunch?

252
00:10:57,991 --> 00:10:59,534
My treat.
- Uh, no.

253
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:00,618
That's all right.
Thank you though.

254
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,037
It's--I gotta do some cleaning.

255
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,455
I should probably
stick around here.

256
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,789
- Hey, know what we could do?

257
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,249
We spread out a blanket
in the break room,

258
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,876
have a little picnic,
order some 'za.

259
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,629
Talk about you know who.

260
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,757
- Oh, um, nope.
You know what?

261
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:14,841
- The P to the A to the M.
- Let's go out.

262
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:15,800
That was a good idea.
Let's go out.

263
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,052
- I know just the place.

264
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,638
[upbeat music]

265
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,641
Oh, man,
you should order milk.

266
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,809
Get it?

267
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:27,854
Why do I like Hooters?

268
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,858
Well, I will give you
two reasons.

269
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,110
The boobs and the hot wings.
[chuckles]

270
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:39,032
- Oh, here we go.
Here we go.

271
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:40,742
Bogey at three o'clock.
Hi.

272
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,327
- Hey, I'm Dana.
Welcome to Hooters.

273
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:45,372
- We're not worthy.
We're not worthy.

274
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,999
Hello, Dana.

275
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,503
I am Michael,
and this is Jim,

276
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,754
and we are brothers.

277
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,631
- Nope.
We're not brothers.

278
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,508
- Well, we're
old fraternity brothers, so...

279
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,592
- Oh, what frat?

280
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,136
[upbeat music]

281
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,930
- Yeah, I rushed
a few fraternities,

282
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,223
but you know what?

283
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,225
I don't believe
in paying for friendships,

284
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:09,270
so I made a decision
not to accept any offers,

285
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,190
and, fortunately,
none were made,

286
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,901
which was good,
so nobody's feelings got hurt.

287
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,028
[laughs]
Just kidding.

288
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,488
I'm just making it up.

289
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,407
I'm his boss, actually,
and I treat him well.

290
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,034
I'm taking him out to lunch
because I can afford it,

291
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,536
and he can have
whatever he wants.

292
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,829
- Can I just have
the ham and cheese sandwich?

293
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,830
- Great.
- Thanks.

294
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,123
- And for you?

295
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,417
- Tell me, Dana,
how is your chicken breast?

296
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,626
- Oh, it's great.

297
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,169
It's served with
our world-famous wing sauce.

298
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:36,548
- Mmm, sounds yummy.
I will have a chicken breast.

299
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,716
Hold the chicken.

300
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,843
- [groans]
- [chuckles]

301
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,428
- Is that what you really want?

302
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:45,098
* *

303
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,975
- No, I'm gonna have
the gourmet hotdog.

304
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,018
- Great.

305
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:50,562
* *

306
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:56,026
- Who took all the black ones?
- That's a communal bowl.

307
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,862
- So how did Oscar sound
when he called in?

308
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,947
- Sick.
Like, lots of sniffling.

309
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,949
I don't know.
- Sniffling how?

310
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:06,286
- Um, how many different ways
are there to sniffle?

311
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,495
- Three.

312
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:09,956
- Okay, it was the second one.

313
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,583
- Okay, good.
Thank you.

314
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,834
That wasn't so hard,
now, was it?

315
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:14,085
- Mm-mm.

316
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,092
- What do you like best
about Pam?

317
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,719
- Oh, I really
don't wanna talk about it.

318
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,846
- Her legs or boobs, or...?

319
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:28,850
- Um, she's easy
to talk to, I guess,

320
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,894
and, uh, she's got
a really good sense of humor.

321
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,354
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

322
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,147
- Never gets
any of my jokes.

323
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,234
- What about you?
- Her boobs definitely.

324
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,987
- Wow, that's not what I meant.

325
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,447
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

326
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:45,116
- And I understand
we have a birthday today.

327
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,410
- Oh, happy birthday, Jim!

328
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:49,454
- Ready, girls?
Front side!

329
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,872
all:
* You put your front side in *

330
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,290
* You put your front side out *

331
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,625
* You put your front side in *

332
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,669
* And you shake it all about *
- Wow.

333
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,296
all: * You do the hokey-pokey
and you turn yourself around *

334
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,173
* That's what it's all about *

335
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:03,009
- Thank you.
- Whoo, yeah!

336
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,678
- Thanks.
Thanks, Dana.

337
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:06,346
- Thank you very much!

338
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,015
- [clears throat]

339
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,271
- Temp, shouldn't you
be monitoring the progress

340
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,482
of people's cleaning efforts?

341
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,567
- Everything seems
pretty much under control.

342
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:23,029
- Yeah, well, I'd hate
to see it blow up in your face.

343
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,700
- How would--
- Let's table that.

344
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,828
So, temp, you seem
to be pretty close

345
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,414
to this Oscar.

346
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:36,292
- Not really.
- Getting defensive?

347
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,794
- No.
- You seem a little nervous.

348
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,381
You shouldn't be.

349
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,635
- Thank you, Dana.
- Sure.

350
00:14:45,677 --> 00:14:47,971
- Keep the change.
Here you go, buddy.

351
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:51,057
Happy birthday.
- Wow, thanks.

352
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,475
- You're welcome.
- No, you know what?

353
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:54,185
Seriously, you should have it.
- No, no, no, no, no.

354
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,396
I have the long sleeve.

355
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,273
And, actually,
you know what we should do?

356
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,649
We should wear 'em
tomorrow to work.

357
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:00,775
It'd be hysterical.
[chuckles]

358
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:01,818
- Ooh, tomorrow.

359
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,944
Uh, that's gonna be tough

360
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,030
'cause I already
laid out my outfit, so...

361
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,656
- Okay, Tuesday.
Whenever.

362
00:15:06,698 --> 00:15:08,283
You better try it on,
make sure it fits.

363
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,410
- Okay.

364
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:13,580
Lunch with Michael was...

365
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,542
Not terrible.

366
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:21,546
Oh, that's hilarious.
Hey.

367
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:23,548
- What did you guys talk about?

368
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,343
Just, you know,
politics, literature.

369
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,179
- I hate you.

370
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,182
- Quick Oscar update.

371
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,225
I have conducted interviews
with everyone in the office--

372
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,144
- Just go to his house
and see if he's sick.

373
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,395
I could've done
this investigation

374
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,898
in, like, 20 minutes.
- Including prep time?

375
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,815
- Just do it.

376
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:47,405
- If I had to,

377
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,824
I could clean out my desk
in five seconds

378
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:52,160
and nobody would ever know
I had ever been here.

379
00:15:53,828 --> 00:15:55,121
And I'd forget too.

380
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,345
- Expense this.
- Michael, is that a wig?

381
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:15,183
- No, it's--
I wear it like that sometimes.

382
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:18,436
Is that a wig?
- This is from Hooters.

383
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,313
- Yeah, it was
a business lunch.

384
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,232
- Did Toby approve this?
- No, he did not.

385
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,401
I don't need his permission.

386
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,444
- You just got your
corporate credit card back.

387
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,238
Do you really want me
to take it away again?

388
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,781
- [groans]
It's ridiculous.

389
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,157
They took my card away

390
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,785
because I spent 80 bucks
at a magic shop.

391
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:37,080
What they don't understand
is that I bought the stuff

392
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:41,418
to impress potential clients,
so business related, right?

393
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,045
I put a cigarette
through a freaking quarter,

394
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:47,132
and you know what, Toby?
They almost bought from us.

395
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,800
- I'm not processing this.

396
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:51,803
- Look, Jim needed
a relaxing lunch.

397
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,304
He has been depressed,

398
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,140
and it has been
affecting his productivity.

399
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,268
How is that not work related?
- He seems fine to me.

400
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,811
- You're not his friend.
You don't know.

401
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,814
He is in love with a girl
he works with who's engaged,

402
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,150
so just cut me
some slack please.

403
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,359
- Pam?

404
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,538
- Hey, Angela,
who would you choose,

405
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,581
Jim or Roy?

406
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,166
- It's nobody's business,
Phyllis.

407
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:23,918
Roy.

408
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:27,714
- Jim has got it bad for Pam.

409
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,467
- [chuckles]
Which one is Pam?

410
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,677
- Well, she's the--

411
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,137
hey, Michael.
- Hm?

412
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,639
- So do you think Jim will try
to break up the wedding?

413
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:37,640
- You know what, Kevin?

414
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,059
Jim is a friend of mine,

415
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,062
so the only people
that this crush really concerns

416
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,022
is Jim and Pam and me.

417
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,901
- As a volunteer
sheriff's deputy,

418
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,070
I've been doing surveillance
for years.

419
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,905
One time,

420
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,908
I suspected an ex-girlfriend
of mine of cheating on me,

421
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:57,077
so I tailed her
for six nights straight.

422
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,496
Turns out she was

423
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:01,790
with a couple of guys,
actually, so...

424
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:06,544
Mystery solved.

425
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:10,632
- Jim, why didn't you tell me
that you had a crush on Pam?

426
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,260
- Well, the cat's
out of the bag.

427
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,429
I used to have a crush on Pam,

428
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:18,890
and now I don't.

429
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:21,518
Riveting.

430
00:18:23,895 --> 00:18:26,272
- Yeah.
- No, it's not.

431
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:27,816
- Nice.

432
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,486
She is so hot.

433
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:37,951
- Hey.
- Hey.

434
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,036
- Did you find anything good
in your desk?

435
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:42,455
- Uh, coupon
for a free sandwich.

436
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:44,666
- Score.
- Expired in August.

437
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,793
And my cell phone charger
from two years ago.

438
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,628
- Big day.
- Big day.

439
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:51,756
Hey, uh, listen.

440
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,010
Um...

441
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:01,057
I told Michael
on the booze cruise--

442
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,475
so stupid.

443
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:03,685
Um...

444
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:10,692
I told Michael that I
had had a crush on you

445
00:19:10,734 --> 00:19:12,986
when you first started here.
- Oh.

446
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,990
- Well, I just thought that--

447
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:20,493
I figured you should
hear it from me...

448
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:23,872
rather than--
I mean, you know Michael.

449
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:25,331
- Right.

450
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:28,168
- And...seriously,

451
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:31,546
it's totally not a big deal.
Okay?

452
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:36,426
And when I found out
that you were engaged, I mean--

453
00:19:36,468 --> 00:19:38,011
- No, I--I know.
- It was like--

454
00:19:38,053 --> 00:19:41,014
- Like, I kind of--
like, I--

455
00:19:41,056 --> 00:19:43,516
I thought that maybe you did
when I first started.

456
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:45,018
- Oh, you did?

457
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,145
- No, I mean, just 'cause we,
like, got along so well.

458
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,438
- No, yeah, no, yeah.

459
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,606
You saw through me.
Great.

460
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,732
[both chuckle]

461
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,694
- So are you gonna be, like,
totally awkward around me now?

462
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,780
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- [laughs]

463
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,949
- Hope that's okay.
- Mm-hmm.

464
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,162
- And Pam.

465
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,248
It was, like,
three years ago,

466
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,335
so I am totally over it.

467
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:14,130
- Cool.
- Okay.

468
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,099
- [whispering]
Stay low.

469
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,100
It's him.

470
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:30,105
This is it.
There he is.

471
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,564
He's been gone
for at least two--

472
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:32,857
who is that?

473
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,235
Come to Papa.

474
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:36,653
[chuckles]

475
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,613
- I got those.

476
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:39,948
- Oh, yes.

477
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,201
Let's roll.
[engine rumbles]

478
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:44,953
I knew it!

479
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,627
Oh, man, you are so busted!

480
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,630
Ice skates?
Shopping bags?

481
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:57,382
I think I know
what's going on here.

482
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:01,261
You weren't sick at all.
- Who's this?

483
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:04,389
- This is Dwight Schrute.
Who is this?

484
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:05,724
- Gil.

485
00:21:06,683 --> 00:21:08,309
- Are you going
to tell Michael?

486
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:09,811
- How about this?

487
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:12,230
I don't tell Michael,
and, in exchange,

488
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,275
you owe me
one great, big, giant favor

489
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:20,238
redeemable by me at a time
and place of my choosing.

490
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,240
Guess what I found out
about Oscar tonight.

491
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,494
He was lying about being sick.

492
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,748
Should I have reported
Oscar's malfeasance?

493
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,958
Hmm, probably.

494
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,169
But now I know something
he doesn't want me to know,

495
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,298
so I can use his malfeasance
to establish leverage.

496
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,633
Otherwise,
it's just malfeasance

497
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:44,220
For malfeasance's sake.

498
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:45,221
[knocks]

499
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:48,683
- Hey.
- I know.

500
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:50,560
I know.
I know.

501
00:21:50,602 --> 00:21:51,728
- Um...

502
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:54,439
What happened?

503
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,857
- I--oh.

504
00:21:55,899 --> 00:21:57,984
Just, um, you know,

505
00:21:58,026 --> 00:21:59,986
I was trying--
just the expense reports,

506
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:02,614
and then--God, Toby, you know?

507
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,824
He just--I know.

508
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:08,870
I just--I just hope that--oh,
I just hope

509
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,039
that this doesn't affect
our friendship!

510
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:13,958
[sobbing]

511
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,836
It's stupid.
It's so stupid.

512
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,588
- Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

513
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:21,299
Listen, man, it's--

514
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:23,093
you know, it's not a big deal.
- Yeah, okay.

515
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,135
- It's gonna be fine.
- I'm fine.

516
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,136
No, I know.
I'm good.

517
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:27,514
I'm good.
It's just--

518
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:30,058
- Look, it's one day.

519
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,142
Everything's
gonna be all right.

520
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:32,143
- Yeah, okay.
- No big deal.

521
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,269
You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

522
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,229
- Okay.

523
00:22:35,897 --> 00:22:38,858
- Creed, did you organize
the menu book?

524
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,654
- Oh, I thought that was
more on a volunteer basis.

525
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:44,906
- No, that was mandatory.

526
00:22:44,948 --> 00:22:46,991
- Oh, I thought
it was a volunteer thing.

527
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,373
- Hey.
- Hey.

528
00:22:53,415 --> 00:22:56,001
- Here's your schedule
for next week.

529
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,711
- [coughs]
- Are you okay?

530
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:01,214
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Look, about you and Jim--

531
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:02,757
- Oh, no, that's--
you don't have to--

532
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,176
- No, I just feel
it's my responsibility

533
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:08,221
as your boss slash friend--
- No, it's really--it's okay.

534
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,724
Um, I know that Jim
had, like, a crush on me

535
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:11,891
when he first started,

536
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,768
but that was
a long time ago, so...

537
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:17,439
- It wasn't that long ago.
It was on the booze cruise.

538
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,900
- Jim had a crush on me
on the booze cruise,

539
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:22,819
or he told you about it
on the booze cruise?

540
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:25,780
- Uh-oh...okay.

541
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:29,409
Shut it, Michael.
I'm done.

542
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:31,327
That's it.
I'm out.

543
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:37,334
- Ready?
- Yep.

544
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:45,967
- People are
always coming to me.

545
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:49,471
"Michael, I have a secret.
You're the only one I trust."

546
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:53,808
No, thanks,
because keeping a secret

547
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,852
can only lead to trouble.

548
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:58,605
Like, I was watching Cinemax
last weekend.

549
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,815
This movie...

550
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:04,611
Portrait of a...Prostitute.

551
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:08,406
Something...Secrets of a--
"More Secrets of a Call Girl."

552
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:12,077
And the lead character, Shila,
is framed for murder,

553
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,120
goes on the run, and winds up

554
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,498
working at a bordello
in Malibu.

555
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:21,378
I don't--I don't wanna
live like that.

556
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,213
I like it here.

557
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:26,174
I don't wanna be Shila.
I like being Michael Scott.

[trumpet flourish]

1
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,305
Let's think this through.

2
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:18,018
If we ask corporate
for that, then...

3
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,979
They are either
gonna say...

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,189
yes or no.

5
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,649
(Michael)
Could go either way.

6
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,985
We don't know
what they are going to say.

7
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,403
Think it through!

8
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:29,362
You have to think it through.

9
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:34,075
Because if they say no...

10
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,285
Can we not?

11
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,203
No--yes, we have to.
You know why?

12
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,997
'Cause I don't like to be
cooped up in that office.

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,665
In that box
all day long.

14
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,083
Heisman!

15
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,128
Because I need to think.
Okay, Jim?

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,421
I need to get out here,

17
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,506
I need to zap around
and make connections.

18
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,758
Ooh, ah, ooh!

19
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:50,759
You know why?

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,719
Because that is how I think,
man.

21
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,637
Do you even know how
to throw a spiral?

22
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,848
You said you did
and that is so not a spiral.

23
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,017
Oh, Kevin!
Ooh!

24
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,478

Right here.
Give it to me.

00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,029
Phyllis, give me the ball.

31
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,072
Okay, give me the ball.

right now.

Jim, do you know how bright
my future is?

00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,659
It's so bright that...

54
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,660
what?

00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,495
Do you know?

Is there something
I gotta wear? Huh?

[imitating rock music]

59
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,178
Dwight was the top salesman
of the year at our company.

60
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,471
He wins a little prize money

61
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,640
and gets honored
at some convention.

62
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:05,894
It is literally the highest
possible honor

Pennsylvania-based

he's got the right to brag.

Oh, they're having
a sale on TiVo.

67
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,744
Maybe I should get a TiVo.

00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,539
Maybe I should
get one of those.

70
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,457
[sighs]

71
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:29,417
You are so lucky, Jim.

72
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,337
You are so lucky
you don't have this problem.

73
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,882
What was the ninth place
prize again?

74
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,134
A loaf of bread?

75
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,761
Cugino's pizza.

76
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,346
Oh, great.

77
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,890
Tasty, terrific pizza.
Hmm.

78
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:48,520
Question.
Do their pizzas play DVDs?

79
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,193
What did I do
to deserve this?

80
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,695
(Pam)
Are you sad
that Dwight beat you?

81
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,570
No.

82
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,863
Are you gonna cry, Jim?

83
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,240
Do you need a tissue?

84
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,991
Hey, I heard you got
a wedding dress.

85
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,159
Do you have pictures?

86
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,536
(Pam)
Oh, yeah.

87
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:07,205
I'll show 'em to you later.
Oh.

88
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,374
Oh, I should get back.
[chuckles]

89
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,375
Talk to you guys later.

90
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:11,960
Okay, cool.

91
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,336
I have a ton of stuff
to do for the wedding.

92
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:15,130
And I have to do it
in the office.

93
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,340
And that can be
kind of awkward.

94
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,719
Uh, just because
people can get all weird

95
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,221
about wedding stuff
and I just--

96
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,515
I don't want to offend...

97
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,643
Angela.
Or someone.

98
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:33,898
That's what she said.

99
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,316
Ha!

100
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,776
I don't get it.

101
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,154
Grapes, seductive.

102
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,740
So you ready for the
big speech this afternoon?

103
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,491
Well, it's not really
a big speech.

104
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,826
You're still coming, right?

105
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,120
Oh, abso-fruit-ly.

106
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,830
Fruit, grapes.
Nailed the joke.

107
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:49,831
Matter of time.

108
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:51,249
Uh, and yes,
it is a big speech.

109
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,542
Biggest of your life.

110
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,546
Speaker
at the sales convention.

111
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,173
Been there, done that.

112
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:00,008
Went there again,
did it again.

113
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:02,093
Two years in a row.

114
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,304
Consecutive.

115
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,681
I just--I miss the feeling

116
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,767
of knowing that
you did a good job

117
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,769
because somebody gives you
proof of it.

118
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,439
"Sir, you're awesome.
Here's a plaque.

119
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,358
"What, a whole year
has gone by

120
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,317
"and you need more proof?

121
00:05:17,359 --> 00:05:18,777
Here's a certificate."

122
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,529
They stopped making plaques
that year.

123
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,907
I thought I could just go
and collect my certificate

124
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,368
and shake the man's hand
and say thank you.

125
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,912
They'll be expecting some
words.

126
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,288
First year,
I spoke for nine minutes.

127
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,748
Second year, 11 minutes.

128
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,541
But you know, it doesn't matter
how long you speak.

129
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,211
What matters is that
you make it perfect.

130
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,587
So make it perfect.

131
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,010
(Dwight)
There was a time

132
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:47,847
where I could've won a trip
to Niagara Falls.

133
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,724
And I think you know
what's there.

134
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,643
But in order to claim
that prize,

135
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,103
I would've had
to shout out

136
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,980
in a room of over 200 people.

137
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,275
I panicked, I froze,
and I paid the price.

138
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:03,988
Sometimes, the hardest word
in the world to say is "bingo."

139
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,367
What if I give a really long
extended thank you?

140
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:10,704
For instance,
"Thank you, Mr. Blank.

141
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,081
"Thank you very, very--

142
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,207
That would look terrible.

143
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,583
These are mostly salesmen,

144
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,502
and salesmen expect
to be entertained.

145
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,337
And you are the main act.

146
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,547
When I was
in the sixth grade,

147
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,508
I was a finalist
in our school spelling bee.

148
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,678
It was me against Raj Patel.

149
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,557
And I misspelled,
in front of the entire school,

150
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,434
the word "failure."

151
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:34,060
I can't do this.

152
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,770
That's because you're incapable
of doing it.

153
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,522
Because you don't know how.

154
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,941
Because you have no skills.

155
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,862
Dwight goes to Michael
for pep talks.

156
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,572
To Michael.

157
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,158
Dwight, there's no way
I can possible teach you

158
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,702
what you need to know about
public speaking by speech time.

159
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,661
Okay.

160
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:53,580
But I can teach you enough

161
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,957
so that you don't embarrass me
or the company.

162
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,167
Okay, deal.

163
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,752
I'll do whatever you say.
No questions asked.

164
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,253
Well, if you have a question,
you should ask me.

165
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,671
I'll try and think of one.

166
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,048
Don't try to think
of a question to humor me.

167
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:05,550
Just try not to be
such an idiot.

168
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,760
Is that an insult

169
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,970
or is that part
of the public speaking advice?

170
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,015
Insult.

171
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,979
I'm very confident,
but I don't want the spotlight.

172
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,814
Michael should get
the spotlight.

173
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,400
I should be the guy
in the booth

174
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,152
shining down the spotlight.

175
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:25,779
[takes deep breath]

176
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,489
(Pam)
Mom, I'm sorry.

177
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,449
I know you and Dad are
chipping in for the wedding,

178
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,117
but I do not want
orange invitations.

179
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,788
Yes.

180
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,831
Well, if you really want...

181
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,708
Hi, yeah, can I talk to one
of your travel agents?

182
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,877
I'm gonna take a trip.

183
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,712
I'm gonna get out of town
for a while

184
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:46,424
and go someplace...

185
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,259
not here.
[chuckles]

186
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,136
Where do I wanna go?

187
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,764
Um, that is
an excellent question.

188
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,350
And one I probably
should have thought about

189
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:56,601
before I called you.

190
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,021
(Oscar)
I get here early
every morning

191
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,148
so I can set
the thermostat.

192
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,276
I like it a little cooler,
around 66 degrees.

193
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,028
I'm more productive.

194
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,281
Maybe some people don't like
it as cold as I do.

195
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,866
But I don't care.

196
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:15,036
And what a lot of people don't
understand about...sales

197
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:18,540
is that it has so much to do
with organization.

198
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,250
I have a system in place
for keeping track

199
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:23,837
of who I speak to,
when I speak to them,

200
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,257
and what we have discussed.

201
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,217
Et cetera.

202
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,177
That's it?

203
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:33,304
You're going to end
with et cetera?

204
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:37,517
Okay, what's this big
organizational system that--

205
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,310
Well, do you think I should
describe our filing system?

206
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,480
No, that would be suicide.
Never--never talk specifics.

207
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,690
Not in a speech.

208
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,650
But the fact that you have
no idea what to say,

209
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,152
is, believe it or not,
the least of our worries.

210
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,611
(Dwight)
It is?
It's your delivery.

211
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,071
What is?
Our biggest worry.

212
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,322
I don't follow.

213
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,742
My God, Dwight. Best way
to learn is by watching.

214
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,994
That's why porn is a
multi-trillion dollar industry.

215
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,663
Let's--okay.
Sit down, let me wow you.

216
00:08:58,705 --> 00:08:59,873
[clears throat]

217
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,499
[screams]
Oh, God!

218
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,667
See?

219
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,711
I have your attention now,
don't I?

220
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:07,005
You're scared, but now you're
ready to learn.

221
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,341
Oh, no. You do not want
to go to India.

222
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,009
It's smelly and it's horrible

223
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,719
and you can't even walk around
by yourself

224
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,554
without getting killed
or worse.

225
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:15,680
That's what my dad says.

226
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:16,765
(Jim)
Oh, okay.

227
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,016
Pam!
Oh, my God!

228
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,517
Can we please start sending out

229
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,727
the save the date
announcements?

230
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,562
'Cause your wedding's
on June 10th

231
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:23,772
and that's right
around the corner

232
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,190
and I know this is weird,

233
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,859
but I really need to know
if I should save the date.

234
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,694
Um--
'Cause if I had
an announcement,

235
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:31,988
then I could start saving up
for a fancy dress.

236
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,240
But otherwise, I'll just get
a pair of shoes.

237
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,701
No, boots.
[coin clinks
in vending machine]

238
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,578
But seriously,
what's the difference

239
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,872
between a salesman
and a saleswoman?

240
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,165
Saleswoman has a vagina.

241
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,042
It's a joke, Dwight.
It's not a sex ed class.

242
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,126
But I'm right.

243
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,252
Yeah, you're right about
the difference

244
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,671
between a man and a woman

245
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,839
but not about the punchline
to the joke, all right?

246
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:53,259
The difference between
a salesman and a saleswoman is

247
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,678
boobs.

248
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,180
Hey, do you remember
the speeches that you gave?

249
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:58,431
I do, both of them.

250
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,391
Could I have a copy
of one of them?

251
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,600
No, no, they would remember.

252
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,228
Look, it doesn't matter
what you say,

253
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,896
it just matters
that you're saying something

254
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,356
that people care about.

255
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:07,565
Yeah?

256
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,234
All right, here we go.
Watch this.

257
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,736
Attention everybody!
Attention please.

258
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,698
I have some very great news
from corporate.

259
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:17,033
We had a wonderful quarter,
and as a result,

260
00:10:17,075 --> 00:10:20,412
all of you are getting bonuses
for $1,000.

261
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,496
Yeah!

262
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:22,706
(Michael)
Congratulations.

263
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,792
[applause and excited chatter]

264
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,879
You see that?

265
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:30,880
You see how
they responded to me?

266
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:33,091
In that moment,
I had them.

267
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,843
That is so great
about the bonus!

268
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:36,428
No, no, it's not true.

269
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,096
I was just talking.

270
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,724
So just go out there
and say anything.

271
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,767
They'll eat it up.
They're a great audience.

272
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,769
Go ahead, get the wallpaper.

273
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,021
Wallpaper the ceiling
if you want.

274
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,023
(Dwight)
Excuse me.

275
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,108
May I have
your attention please?

276
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,611
There had been an accident
on 84 West.

277
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,654
Cars have skidded
off the road

278
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,489
into the safety railing.

279
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:58,616
Several cars have flipped.

280
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,493
There is broken glass
everywhere.

281
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:02,746
Several people are injured.

282
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:06,124
Do we know anyone
who was in the accident?

283
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,586
Brad Pitt.

284
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,129
Also, there will be
no bonuses.

285
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,964
Why would this affect
our bonuses?

286
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,341
They're unrelated.

287
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,592
Is Brad okay?

288
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,135
He will never act again.

289
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,554
Also, this branch is closing.

290
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,722
What the hell
is going on here?

291
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:21,723
Are we out of jobs?

292
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,183
Yes.

293
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,226
This is karma because of what
he did to Jennifer Anniston.

294
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,853
He was kidding.
Dwight was kidding.

295
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,647
And I don't know why
because it wasn't funny

296
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,400
and it was just horrible.

297
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,693
Michael?
Yeah?

298
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,278
You said we were
getting bonuses.

299
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,321
That was just a funny joke,
remember?

300
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,739
You applauded.

301
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:38,823
So nobody's hurt?

302
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,200
I don't know about that.

303
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,160
People are injured in car
accidents every 4.5 seconds.

304
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,745
Shut

305
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,038
it.
Come on.

306
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,875
Teri, cancel the wallpaper.

307
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,587
[Michael sighs]

308
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,005
Well, that didn't go well.

309
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,840
No, it did not
and that is because

310
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:59,010
at no time did you employ
the use of humor.

311
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,180
We'll find you a joke
that not even you can ruin.

312
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,767
[laughs]

313
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,854
All right. Listen up, please.
Dwight has a joke.

314
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,446
[softly]
Stop it.

315
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,032
Two sailors walk into a bar.

316
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,076
Please don't tell
a sailor joke.

317
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,494
Oh, why not?

318
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,912
Her nephew's in Iraq.

319
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,039
Iraq is sand.
Sailors are on water.

320
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:30,208
Yes, but they're both
in danger.

321
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,211
Yeah, well, you know what?
We need to--

322
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:35,171
all right, everybody
in the conference room now.

323
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:37,507
Let's go.
Let's do it.

324
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,885
As your leader
and your friend,

325
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,513
I sort of demand
that you can all

326
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:45,557
speak in public
as I can.

327
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,475
And did.
Twice.

328
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,853
You saw the plaque, right?

329
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,063
(Michael)
All right, we're all
gonna go around the room

330
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,481
and we're going
to make toasts.

331
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,026
And that way,
we will overcome our fear

332
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,110
of public speaking.

333
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:58,653
You mean Toastmasters?

334
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,863
Pam, I'm public speaking.

335
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,907
Stop public interrupting me.
Okay?

336
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,617
Who's gonna start?
How about Phyllis?

337
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,411
You kick us off and
then we'll move around.

338
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,370
Go ahead.

339
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:08,496
What are we supposed
to talk about?

340
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,915
Anything your heart desires.

341
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,504
Um, I would like to toast

342
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,466
to the good fortune
I've been having lately.

343
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,051
Louder!

344
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:25,055
[slightly louder]
I met a man
and I'm totally in love.

345
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:28,558
And that's a chapter of my life
that I thought I'd closed.

346
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,563
Uh, I was terribly depressed
for the longest time

347
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:37,817
and, um, I have to admit,
I had some very dark thoughts.

348
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:38,985
Good, good, good, good.
That's good.

349
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,737
Now see,
that's not so hard, right?

350
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,782
All right, who's next?
Who are we going to go--ah!

351
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,200
Ryan.
Ryan's next.

352
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:48,036
Why am I next?
I thought we'd go in order.

353
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,329
Don't be shy, shy boy.

354
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:51,664
Don't be shy.
Get up there.

355
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:54,668
Well, a lot of you know
that I'm in business school

356
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,087
and while I'm learning
a lot here,

357
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:58,171
a lot,

358
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,298
hopefully soon,
I'll land a challenging,

359
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,636
full-time or part-time position
somewhere else.

360
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,012
[cheers and applause]

361
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,723
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
That's--you know what?

362
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,767
The toasts are really not
supposed to be about anything.

363
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,478
And certainly not supposed
to be about going anywhere

364
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,314
or doing anything else.
So.

365
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:20,944
Ryan is a temp and that means
that he could go at any time.

366
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,155
Am I worried about that?

367
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,241
Try scared to death.

368
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,243
Who's next?
Pammy.

369
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,161
Oh.
That's okay.

370
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,539
Actually, this would be
good practice

371
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,416
for your wedding toast.

372
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,168
Yeah, the bride doesn't
really do--

373
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,170
Have you ever been
to a wedding?

374
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,047
(Jim)
Can I go?

375
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,966
Yes, good.
Jim taking the initiative.

376
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:48,304
So, uh,
I am going on a trip.

377
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:50,140
But I'm not really sure
where I'm going yet.

378
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:51,683
It's kinda open-ended.

379
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:54,185
So I was hoping maybe you guys
would have some suggestions.

380
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:57,188
It's not off to a good start,
but we'll see where this goes.

381
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,940
I really like Florida.
(Jim)
Oh, really?

382
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,068
Like Miami or?
More of the Orlando area.

383
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,029
I've been to Epcot
a dozen times.

384
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,613
It's like a trip
around the world.

385
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,866
Oh, well, I was actually
thinking of taking a trip

386
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,284
around the actual world.

387
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,745
Then you should look into
the Disney cruise.
Okay.

388
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,747
You should go
to Hedonism.

389
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,457
What is that?

390
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:19,252
It's like Club Med,
but everything is naked.

391
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:21,796
I was thinking
more like Europe.

392
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:25,008
Or something like that,
but good second choice.

393
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,217
Been to Amsterdam.

394
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,762
Oh, okay, you know what?

395
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:30,555
That's not a toast.
You're not standing up.

396
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,017
To Amsterdam.

397
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:35,518
When did you go there?

398
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,854
Um, after my divorce.

399
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,023
(Jim)
Really?
For like how long?

400
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:42,275
About a week or...

401
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:43,610
Maybe a month.
I don't--

402
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,111
Jimmy, listen to me.

403
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,906
You do not want to go
to Amsterdam, trust me.

404
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,115
Where do I wanna go?

405
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,534
I'd send you to Hong Kong.

406
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,953
I know some fun places.
You could hang there.

407
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:57,165
And I might still have
some friends.

408
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,584
Really?
Really, Creed?

409
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,712
I was a action movie star
in China in the '80s

410
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:03,963
after my band broke up.

411
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:08,385
And, um, I played a lot
of police captains.

412
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:09,386
[chuckles]

413
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,388
Sometimes a cowboy.
I'm, uh...

414
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:13,473
kind of a movie star there.

415
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,225
I'd like to say hi
to my friends in China.

416
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:19,354
[speaking Chinese]

417
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,398
(Michael)
You know what?

418
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,482
Maybe we should move on
to somebody else.

419
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,234
Okay.
Do you have a suggestion?

420
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,319
Actually, yes. I do.
I have a fantastic suggestion.

421
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,529
(Jim)
All right.

422
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:28,655
Three words.
(Jim)
Okay.

423
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:31,491
Vegas, baby, Vegas!
Yes.

424
00:16:31,533 --> 00:16:34,244
Also San Antonio is nice.
River Walk. [clicks tongue]

425
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,663
Ooh, River Walk?
Like Michael Flatley?

426
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:38,248
N-no, that's "River Jazz."

427
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,417
Okay, everybody sit down,
please.

428
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,918
Riverdance.

429
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,422
Okay. Dwight.
[claps once]

430
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:48,258
Show us what you have
learned today.

431
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:54,139
Good morning, Vietnam!

432
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,558
[all groan]

433
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,482
Okay.
My wife is very neat.

434
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,152
Every wrinkle is
in its right place.

435
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,281
A good salesman can convince
his wife

436
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,159
that polyester
is the generic name for mink.

437
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,162
[chuckles]
Packer.

438
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,413
Okay, you know what?
This isn't working.

439
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:21,166
Because, um, I'm not nervous
in front of them.

440
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,542
They're my subordinates.

441
00:17:22,584 --> 00:17:24,002
No, we're not.

442
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,462
Uh, yes, you are.

443
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,047
I am the
assistant regional manager.

444
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,840
Which means
absolutely nothing.

445
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:29,924
Michael, can you explain?

446
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:33,428
Well, it's mostly made up.
So.

447
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,513
(Michael)
Dwight is not going to do
a good job. It's sad.

448
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:36,848
And they're
expecting excellence

449
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,183
because I did do
such a great job.

450
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,727
Two years in a row, I killed.
It was amazing.

451
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,064
Confidence, Dwight!

452
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,649
To give you an idea
how well I did,

453
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:50,362
how much they laughed,
they started laughing...

454
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,488
[snaps]
Now.

455
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,746
[slurps]

456
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,674
And that was just my opener.

457
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,391
Dwight, if you could travel
anywhere in the world,

458
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,558
where would you go?

459
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,435
I can travel anywhere,
except Cuba.

460
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,854
And I will travel
to New Zealand

461
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,147
and walk the
Lord of the Ringstrail

462
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:27,315
to Mordor.

463
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,566
And then I will
hike Mt. Doom.

464
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,319
So now just leave me alone.

465
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:33,154
Okay, just trying to
get some advice on my trip.

466
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,699
Oh, please,
you're not taking any trip.

467
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:44,124
You know, I majored
in public speaking in college?

468
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,750
You did?
Mm-hmm.

469
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:47,085
And the first thing
that they teach you

470
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:50,130
is that you've gotta be true
to yourself.

471
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,924
And you are all about
authority.

472
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:55,176
Yes, I am.

473
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:56,970
The great speakers
throughout history

474
00:18:57,012 --> 00:19:00,223
were not joke-tellers,
they were people of passion.

475
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,599
So, if you wanna
do well today,

476
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,809
you gotta do
what they did.

477
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:03,977
Which is?

478
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,478
You've gotta wave
your arms,

479
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,564
and you've gotta
pound your fists.

480
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,150
Many times.
[pounds fists]

481
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,526
So as to emphasize
your point.

482
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:14,487
Okay, I didn't actually major
in public speaking.

483
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,156
But I did download speeches

484
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,158
from some of history's
famous dictators.

485
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,784
Like this one.

486
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:22,662
Originally given
by Benito Mussolini.

487
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:24,998
And this one here was
by his good friend,

488
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,666
Jumpin' Joe Stalin.

489
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,252
And just to change things up...

490
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:30,712
here's a little Idi Amin.

491
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:33,006
Okay, look, I know
you're giving this speech

492
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:35,550
on your own, but I wrote up
a few talking points

493
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,718
for you to take a look at.

494
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,053
Hope you don't mind.

495
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,429
I'll glance at it.

496
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,980
(Creed)
I like it hot.

497
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,607
Really, really hot.

498
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:54,986
[door opens]

499
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:57,739
(Ryan)
I got the stamps.

500
00:19:57,781 --> 00:19:59,115
The ones that say "love"
on them?

501
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,242
The ones that say 39¢.

502
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:03,370
Oh.
Doesn't matter.

503
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,455
I didn't think it did.

504
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:07,791
As soon as they leave,
we'll get Kelly and start.

505
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,252
Kelly's helping?
Is that okay?

506
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,754
Yeah, sure.

507
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:17,801
I don't know what's wrong.

508
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:21,304
I keep having these hot
and cold flashes.

509
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:22,847
Uh-oh.

510
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,727
It's time, Dwight.
The Grim Reaper is here.

511
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,817
The very best of luck to you,
Dwight.

512
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:34,901
Thank you, Angela.

513
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:49,332
[takes deep breath]

514
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:56,256
Ghosts. Lotta ghosts
in this old Radisson.

515
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,676
There it is.
Rosebud room.

516
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:00,927
Memories.

517
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:06,599
Wow.
This turnout is pathetic.

518
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:07,600
I packed the house, you know?

519
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:10,687
Oh, I don't think this is it.

520
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,858
Numismatic--
Numismatic Collectors.

521
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,359
Nope.
Wrong room.

522
00:21:17,819 --> 00:21:19,696
Okay.

523
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:25,035
They got sports
medicine seminar. Nope.

524
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,998
Science fiction convention.
Nope.

525
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,791
Oh, yeah. I read about that.

526
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,335
The entire cast
of Battlestar Galactica

527
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,627
is gonna be here
including Starbuck.

528
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:35,795
I'm so in love with her.

529
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:36,838
You're weird.

530
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,340
No, no, no.

531
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,674
It's totally normal 'cause
she's not a Cylon or anything.

532
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,926
She's just a great
human fighter pilot.

533
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,012
And if I see her,
my heart will explode.

534
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:45,138
Are you a 12-year-old girl?

535
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,432
I didn't know--there we go.

536
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,310
Why'd you pick the VA
for the reception?

537
00:21:50,352 --> 00:21:51,603
Roy has a connection.

538
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,730
It's nicer than you think.

539
00:21:55,607 --> 00:21:57,359
You're inviting Jim?

540
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,444
Of course, he's one
of my closest friends.

541
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,030
Okay, so I mulled it over

542
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:04,449
and I'm not really into India
or Amsterdam.

543
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,618
Or that Morocco package.

544
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,661
Good, right?
So we're narrowing it down.

545
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:12,999
Okay, let's talk about
East Asia.

546
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:15,919
Oh, and South America.

547
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,047
No, I'm not trying
to waste your time, Carol.

548
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:20,465
You know what?

549
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,258
Can you tell me about the India
thing one more time?

550
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,762
Nothing's really jumping out
at me.

551
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:27,555
So--I mean, the good news is

552
00:22:27,597 --> 00:22:30,642
now I know I want
to take a trip.

553
00:22:30,684 --> 00:22:34,396
So I'll just keep my eyes out
for the next few weeks

554
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:38,483
and get a great deal.

555
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,195
(Michael)
All right. Ready?

556
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:43,279
[exhales heavily]

557
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:44,322
Here we go!

558
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:45,573
[exhales heavily]

559
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,703
[indistinct chatter]

560
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:52,455
Wow, it's a little bit bigger
than I remember.

561
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:56,668
Come on, we're down here
in the front.

562
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:02,048
[techno music buildup]

563
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:06,553

564
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:07,846
* Y'all ready for this *

[2 Unlimited's
"Get Ready For This"]

566
00:23:12,225 --> 00:23:13,435
[coughs]

567
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:16,896
[Angela sniffles]

568
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,027
I am just feeling
under the weather.

569
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:25,572
And I think that I will
go home and rest.

570
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:28,283
I've never, ever seen you
take a sick day.

571
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:31,911
Well, I've seen you take enough
for the both of us.

572
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:35,457
Next, I'd like to introduce
the Dunder Mifflin

573
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:38,877
salesman of the year,
Dwight Schrute!

574
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,838
[applause]

575
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:46,593
Dwight, they called your name.

576
00:23:46,634 --> 00:23:48,136
(emcee)
Dwight, how we doing?

577
00:23:48,636 --> 00:23:49,596
[mumbling]
No, I can't do it.

578
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,056
Okay, you know what?

579
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,515
You know what? Okay.
[hyperventilating]

580
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:53,600
No--no problem.

581
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:54,726
You are lucky
you have me here.

582
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,186
I am going
to cover for you.

583
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,354
[claps]
All right!

584
00:23:57,395 --> 00:24:00,482
[applause]

00:24:00,523 --> 00:24:02,650
[whistling]

586
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:08,031
Good morning, Vietnam!

587
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:14,412
I am not Dwight Schrute.

588
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:15,955
Not at all.

589
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:20,460
I am Michael Scott,
his mentor and boss.

590
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:23,713
Some of you, I'm sure, know me.

591
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:27,884
I have been honored by this
illustrious group twice

592
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:31,680
and I think I
am the first person

593
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:35,475
that was honored by this group
two years in a row.

594
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:39,479
Does anybody know differently?
Or?

595
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,648
No?

596
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:45,652
Well, until Dwight comes up,

597
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:49,114
if he ever does,

598
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,658
I wanted to say
a few words about excellence.

599
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:56,705
What makes a work environment
excellent?

600
00:24:56,746 --> 00:25:00,709
Well, there are many things,
I believe,

601
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,629
that do such a thing
of that...nature.

602
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:09,009
And one would be humor.

603
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:12,721
What is the difference
between a salesman

604
00:25:12,762 --> 00:25:14,931
and a saleswoman?

605
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:24,149
[vent starts whooshing]

606
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,277
I always set it at 69.

607
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:28,820
[chuckles]

608
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:33,074
I'm right by the air vent.
I get a lot of dust in my eyes.

609
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:35,201
Maybe we'll use a DJ.

610
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,537
That's the one thing Roy's
in charge of for this wedding,

611
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,040
but all he's managed to do
is set a date.

612
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:43,043
Well, he did a great job.
June 10th is perfect.

613
00:25:43,084 --> 00:25:46,379
I want a June wedding.
I've always wanted one.

614
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:49,799
Ryan, do you know when
you would want to get married?

615
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:52,052
Actually, I don't see
ever getting married.

616
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,261
Oh.

617
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,520
Ryan, you should be
more sensitive.

618
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:05,398
It's obvious she likes you,
and comments like that, they--

619
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,568
I know what I said.

620
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,153
I'm very sorry,
I did not know

621
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:11,654
that you were wearing
a hearing aid

622
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:13,573
and I just thought
you were speaking...

623
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:16,242
abnormally.

624
00:26:16,284 --> 00:26:21,081
And now, the Black guy from
the Police Academymovies.

625
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:23,708
A robot.

626
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:28,129
[making robot sounds]

627
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,006
Michael Winslow.
Anyone?

628
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:36,054
A car starting.
[makes car starting sound]

629
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:38,890
And now, some race car.

630
00:26:38,932 --> 00:26:42,018
[imitating race car]

631
00:26:47,023 --> 00:26:49,943
Well, isn't that--
well, isn't that special?

632
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:58,410
Jell-O pudding.

633
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:03,248
[microphone thumps]
Is this on? Hello.

634
00:27:03,832 --> 00:27:07,043
[baby crying]

635
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:08,837
Could you shut him up, please?

636
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:11,214
I mean, who brings a baby
to a sales conference?

637
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:12,882
Rude.

638
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,468
All right,
Dwight Schrute, everyone.

639
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,679
[applause]

640
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,347
Good luck.
That is a tough crowd.

641
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:22,350
[applause]

642
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:27,022
[breathing heavily
into microphone]

643
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:31,276
[Dwight sniffles loudly]

644
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,737
[Dwight clearing throat]

645
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:39,868
Blood alone moves the wheels
of history!

646
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:43,663
Have you ever
asked yourselves

647
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,749
in an hour of meditation,

648
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:49,377
which everyone finds
during the day,

649
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:52,797
how long we have been striving
for greatness?

650
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,843
Not only the years we've been
at war,

651
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:59,012
the war of work,

652
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:02,557
but from the moment,
as a child,

653
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:07,187
when we realized that the world
could be conquered,

654
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:10,398
it has been
a lifetime struggle.

655
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,941
A never-ending fight.

656
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:15,195
I say to you,
and you will understand,

657
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:18,907
that it is a privilege
to fight!

658
00:28:18,948 --> 00:28:22,285
[scattered applause]

659
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:27,207
We are warriors!

660
00:28:27,248 --> 00:28:28,792
[applause]

661
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:31,711
[whistling and applause]

662
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:34,464
(Dwight)
Salesmen of Northeastern
Pennsylvania,

663
00:28:34,506 --> 00:28:37,967
I ask you, once more,
rise and be worthy

664
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:40,095
of this historical hour!

665
00:28:40,136 --> 00:28:42,430
[cheers and applause]

666
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:45,809
[Dwight laughing]

667
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,977
(Dwight)
Yeah, yeah!

668
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,689
I got a time share
on Key West

669
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,400
that might be available.

670
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:55,777
Maybe?
Thanks.

671
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:56,945
You really think
you're gonna go?

672
00:28:56,986 --> 00:28:58,279
Yeah, I'm definitely going.

673
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:00,949
Nice.
Send me a postcard.

674
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,118
(Ryan)
Jim has worked at the
same place for five years.

675
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:04,786
Jim eats the same ham
and cheese sandwich

676
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,496
every day for lunch.

677
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:07,956
I don't know,
if I were a betting man,

678
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:09,958
I'd say he will have
a fun weekend

679
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,418
in Philadelphia.

680
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:26,016
[exhales deeply]

681
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:40,488
No revolution is worth anything
unless it can defend itself!

682
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,658
[applause]

683
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:48,288
(Dwight)
Some people will tell you
"salesman" is a bad word.

684
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:52,250
They'll conjure up images
of used car dealers

685
00:29:52,292 --> 00:29:55,170
and door-to-door charlatans.

686
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:59,007
This is our duty
to change their perception.

687
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:02,677
I say, salesmen...

688
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:06,389
and women of the world, unite!

689
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:11,603
We must never acquiesce,
for it is together...

690
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:15,190
together that we prevail!

691
00:30:15,231 --> 00:30:19,861
We must never cede control
of the motherland,

692
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:21,780
for it is?

693
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:25,784
[all]
Together that we prevail!

694
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:29,037
[wild cheers and applause]

695
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,379
Australia?

696
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,963
I have always wanted
to go there.

697
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:40,090
I'm going.

698
00:30:40,131 --> 00:30:41,424
I'm a little nervous
to run into Dwight

699
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:43,093
on his connecting flight
to Mordor,

700
00:30:43,134 --> 00:30:45,345
but other than that...

701
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,972
Yeah, I bought the ticket.
Non-refundable.

702
00:30:48,014 --> 00:30:49,724
That's awesome.
Where are you staying?

703
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,017
I don't know.

704
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:52,268
I feel like I have
plenty of time

705
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,645
to figure out the details,
but...

706
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:56,147
When are you leaving?

707
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:58,566
I'm leaving on June 8th.

708
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:01,111
Oh.

709
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:02,445
(Jim)
Yeah.

710
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:04,197
And I'm really sorry
about that. I just--

711
00:31:04,239 --> 00:31:08,118
Oh, yeah,
that's too bad.

712
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,704
Yeah.

713
00:31:13,164 --> 00:31:15,125
Do want me to take these
on my way out?

714
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:17,961
It's okay, I got it.

715
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:19,004
All right.

716
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:22,132
[indistinct chatter]

717
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:25,093
Okay, thanks.

718
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,845
There you are.
What happened?

719
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,638
I got thirsty.
How'd it go?

720
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,057
It was amazing. I wish
you would have been there.

721
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:33,268
You would not believe
what happened here.

722
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:34,436
What, did something happen?

723
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:38,857
Oh, this woman came in.
Sat down.

724
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,108
Ordered a drink.

725
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:41,818
The bartender
asked for her ID,

726
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,944
which I thought was odd.

727
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:44,112
Because I pegged her at,
like, 35.

728
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:45,905
Weird.
Yeah, really weird.

729
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:47,866
So she's like,
"I don't have my ID.

730
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:48,950
Please give me one."
Uh-huh?

731
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,326
And he's like,
"I can't do that."

732
00:31:50,368 --> 00:31:51,870
I can't serve you.

733
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,288
Con artist.
She might have been.

734
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:55,749
So she says
"Fine, I will go to my room.

735
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,625
"I will get my purse.
I will come back.

736
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:58,752
I'll show you my ID."

737
00:31:58,793 --> 00:32:00,420
She hasn't come back yet.

738
00:32:00,462 --> 00:32:03,465
She's probably in the room
drinking from the minibar.

739
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:05,842
[laughing]
(Michael)
Right?

740
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,385
(Michael)
Dwight gave a great speech.

741
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:09,387
That's the word
on the street, anyway.

742
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:13,266
And I entertained Dwight
to no end with my bar story.

743
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:18,938
So I captivated the guy
who captivated 1,000 guys.

744
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,149
Can you believe that?
1,000 guys.

1
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,305
- I don't know, Pam.

2
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,599
I paid $400 for this phone,

3
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,892
because I liked the ring.

4
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,477
- You did?
- And now,

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,731
I realize that you can program
or download any ring you want,

6
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:25,066
so I'm...a little overwhelmed.

7
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,152
- Yeah.
- There's a lot of choices.

8
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,362
You got to help me here.
- Okay.

9
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,572
- Which one of these
is coolest?

10
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,115
What do you think?

- Ooh, that one was good.
- Are you kidding me?

No, that one says,
"I am so lame."

17
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,672
You know which one I want?

18
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,717
There's one that sounds
like a jackhammer.

19
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,469
It just really grabs
your attention.

20
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,555
It's like--

00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,563
- Okay.

22
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,232
- You know what
I'm talking about?

23
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,193
- Do you mean "vibrate"?

24
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,864
- Yes.

I'm happy to be here.

29
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,318
It's very nice
to see all of you.

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,653
You're all looking well.

31
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:54,155
- Today's a Women
in the Workplace thing.

32
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,615
Jan's coming in from corporate

33
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:59,703
to talk to all the women
about, um...

34
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,162
I don't really know what,

35
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,872
but Michael's not allowed in.

36
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,916
She said that
about five times.

37
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,420
- Women today, though we have
the same options as men,

38
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,756
we often face a very
different set of obstacles

39
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,591
in getting there, so--
[knock on door]

40
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,385
- Hey, what's going on?
- Michael, I--

41
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:16,928
- Yeah, you know what?
- I thought we agreed--

42
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,555
- I thought about it.
I just have few things

43
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,348
I want to say.
[clears throat]

44
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,558
- What are you doing?

45
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,268
- Just hear me out.
[clears throat]

46
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,520
What is more important
than quality?

47
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:26,604
Equality.

48
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:29,232
Now, studies show
that today's woman--

49
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,276
the Ally McBeal woman,
as I call her--

50
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,527
is at a crossroads.

51
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,571
- Michael.
- And--no, just, I...

52
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,531
You have come a long way, baby,

53
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,409
but I just--just wanna
keep it within reason.

54
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,619
They did this up in Albany--
- You are not allowed in--

55
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,246
- And they ended up
turning the break room

56
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,956
into a lactation room,
which is disgusting.

57
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,791
- Now you're really
not allowed in this session.

58
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,668
- Well, I'm their boss, so--
- I'm your boss.

59
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:56,217
- Anybody want any coffee
or anything?

60
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,302
- We're fine, Michael.

61
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,470
We just need you
to leave, please.

62
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,388
- Women in the Workplace.

63
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,307
Yeah, translation:

64
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,933
I have been banned
from my own conference room

65
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,269
so that Jan can talk in secret
to all the girls.

66
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,563
Oh, sorry.
Women of the workplace.

67
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,856
About what?
I don't know.

68
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,942
Clothes, me...

69
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,027
Ick.

70
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,821
- Ladies, I am so, so sorry.

71
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,908
Can we...start again?
We were on such a roll.

72
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,826
I--I really apologize for that.
- Jan.

73
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:22,994
- Yes, Pam?

74
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,330
- Michael's still at the door.
- Michael!

75
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,291
So one obstacle
is how assertiveness

76
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,669
is perceived differently
in men and women.

77
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,338
Men who are assertive
tend to be admired.

78
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,257
They're called...anyone?

79
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,677
- That's a terrible idea.

80
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,678
- What is?

81
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,638
- Them in there, all together.

82
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,847
They stay in there too long,

83
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,892
they're gonna get
on the same cycle.

84
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,560
Wreak havoc on our plumbing.

85
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,022
- So one obstacle is

86
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,274
how assertiveness is
perceived differently

87
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:54,693
in men and women.

88
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,320
Men who are assertive
tend to be admired.

89
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,365
They're called...anyone?

90
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,700
- Sexy.
- Confident.

91
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,159
- Great.

92
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,037
Whereas women who are assertive
tend to be labeled...

93
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,665
- The C-word.
- I was gonna say the B-word.

94
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:11,751
- Everyone.
Guys, circle up, please.

95
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,336
Come on over.
Bring your chairs.

96
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,047
Toby, come on over.

97
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,966
You're a guy too.

98
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,217
[mumbles]
Sort of.

99
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,885
Let's do this.

100
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,304
- So to be in a position
of leadership,

101
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,724
you often need to be assertive,
right?

102
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,518
You have to be able
to state a firm opinion.

103
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,270
And this means that you have
to give up the fantasy

104
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,272
of being everyone's friend.

105
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,857
[clattering]

106
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,900
- Well, first of all...
[clattering]

107
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,486
I, uh, just wanna
warm up a little bit.

108
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:41,156
Now, I know this is going
to sound crazy to you,

109
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,159
but in India, they do this
thing called laughter therapy,

110
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,410
and I want to try it out.

111
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,412
It's when a group of people
just get together

112
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,914
and they laugh
as hard as they can.

113
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,583
So I want to try that
with you right now.

114
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,084
On the count of three,
let's laugh as hard

115
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,502
and loudly as we can.

116
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,379
Ready?
One, two, three.

117
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,549
[laughter]

118
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,557
- Oh, my goodness.

119
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,933
- Let's just clap.
Let's just clap.

120
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,185
Ready?

121
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,936
[all clapping]
Yeah!

122
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,605
Yeah! That's what
I'm talking about!

123
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,648
- Okay, I don't know what
you're doing here, Michael--

124
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,651
- Just having a little
Guys in the Workplace thing.

125
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:22,781
Why can't boys play with dolls?

126
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,991
Why does society

127
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,327
force us to use urinals

128
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,870
when sitting down
is far more comfortable?

129
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,081
- Can you please do this
somewhere else, Michael?

130
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,707
- We have nowhere else, Jan.

131
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:33,833
This...

132
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,502
- We could do it
in the warehouse.

133
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,295
- Dwight, excellent idea.
Go to the warehouse.

134
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,047
- Okay, fine.
Yeah, actually, perfect.

135
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,674
Perfect!
You know what?

136
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,885
There is another side
to this place, gentlemen.

137
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:46,137
And I know we all love
our cushy jobs

138
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,056
and our fun, exciting office,

139
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,183
but do you realize
that underneath us,

140
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:51,559
there is another world.

141
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,977
The warehouse world.

142
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,856
A world that is teeming
with sweat and dirt

143
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,983
and life!

144
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,193
Life.

145
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,320
The bowels of the office.

146
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,488
These guys are down there.

147
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,116
They are real men
doing real men's work.

148
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,703
Why don't we go down there
and bond with those guys

149
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,079
over some conversation?

150
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:15,417
- Because men don't bond
over conversation.

151
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,794
They bond over activity.
- Shut it.

152
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,337
Okay. Yes.

153
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,882
Right, so we are going to learn

154
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:26,011
about being real men for a day.

155
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,929
White collar
and the blue collar.

156
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,180
United.

157
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,183
We are going to learn
how a warehouse works.

158
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,601
- Whoo! Let's go.

159
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,353
- I would love to learn

160
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,189
how an office works.

161
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,482
- We're gonna head down there.

162
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,193
All of us guys,
and all of those guys.

163
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,361
Together.

164
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,239
We're gonna be one guy today.

165
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:48,199
The office and the warehouse.

166
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,285
The woffice.

167
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,911
Journey of self-discovery.

168
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,541
Oh, I think this is
gonna work out great.

169
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,460
Because managing the warehouse

170
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,337
is a very important part
of my job.

171
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,797
And I haven't been there
in months.

172
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,925
[beeping]
[hip-hop music]

173
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:12,932
* *

174
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,449
- Remember on "Lost,"
when they met the Others?

175
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,578
- I am so sorry about that.

176
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,747
Um, so where were we?

177
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,999
Pam, are you okay
taking notes then?

178
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:38,958
- Mm-hmm.
- Please?

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,127
- Yeah.
- Thank you very much.

180
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:44,422
[hip-hop music]

181
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,882
[music stops]
- Inventive.

182
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,723
All right.
Here we are.

183
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,893
This is cool.
This is cool.

184
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,019
Wow.

185
00:07:58,061 --> 00:07:59,729
Culture shock here, huh?

186
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,148
This is like
"Meet the Fockers,"

187
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,234
except it's
"Meet the Warehouse."

188
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,196
So let's meet the warehouse!

189
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:10,657
Let's get some shots.

190
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,951
Pan around there.

191
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,037
This is Darryl,
one of our warehouse staff.

192
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,832
Darryl, what is
your biggest fear?

193
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,667
- My biggest fear is
that someone will distract us

194
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:22,252
from getting all
the shipments out on time.

195
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,754
You know what? Darrell is
actually the foreman here,

196
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,631
and not Roy, which is cool.
[pallet jack beeping]

197
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,717
There's Roy,
ridin' the big rig!

198
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,344
Um, so Roy is actually
going to be marrying Pam

199
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:32,971
sometime this summer.

200
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,181
And, uh,
she's our receptionist.

201
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,058
Sort of a Brangelina thing.

202
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,309
- Why?

203
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,688
- Brangelina is
the Brad Pitt and Angelina--

204
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,398
- I don't understand.
- Roy--Roy and Pam.

205
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,899
It's a Ram.

206
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,027
It's a Ram thing.
Not--well...

207
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,405
So, Roy, what do you love
about guys?

208
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,157
- What?
- [imitates Roy]

209
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,366
Good interview, fella.

210
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:54,659
[chuckles]
This guy.

211
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,703
Oh! Get him!

212
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,996
Pan in on him.

213
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:01,499
I love this guy.
I love this guy!

214
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,084
Tell the camera your name.

215
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,836
- Why don't you tell them
my name?

216
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,548
- I don't want
to mispronounce it.

217
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,009
- It's Lonny.
- That is easy.

218
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:14,179
So, Lonny, why did you
not get into the NFL?

219
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,848
Was it the knees, or...
I'm sure you were drafted.

220
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,516
- What? Michael,
shouldn't you be upstairs

221
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,809
with the rest of the women?

222
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,353
- Well, I should be
asking the questions.

223
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,563
- Well, why don't you ask me
how I feel about those shoes?

224
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,902
[laughter]

225
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,781
- Okay.
They're pretty stupid.

226
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,158
[laughter continues]

227
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,660
Let's trade shoes.
Let me put on your boots.

228
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,371
I want to put on your boots.

229
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,747
Take them off.

230
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,251
All right, so...

231
00:09:57,347 --> 00:10:01,059
- I bet Roy heard
about you liking Pam.

232
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,728
I bet he'll try to beat you up.

233
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,897
- Thanks for
the heads-up, Kev.

234
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,899
- I got your back,
if he does.

235
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,071
But try to stay out of it.

236
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,197
- [clears throat]

237
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,657
Just in case there's
somebody down here

238
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:16,908
who shouldn't be.

239
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,702
A little "Good Will Hunting"
situation.

240
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,328
All right, troops.

241
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,915
This is...an important day.
A big day.

242
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:27,377
Now, you may look around

243
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:30,005
and see two groups here.

244
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,423
White collar, blue collar.

245
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,759
But I don't see it that way,
and you know why not?

246
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,970
Because I am collar-blind.

247
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,517
I see a group of men.

248
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,602
Do you think

249
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,563
that you are better
than they are?

250
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,107
Well, you're not.
You're worse.

251
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,276
These guys are heroes.
They're men.

252
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,695
Men who work with their hands,
and not their minds.

253
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,196
- What?
- Check out this guy's hands.

254
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,072
Look at that.

255
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,700
Oh, baby soft.
- Stop it.

256
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,952
- He's a pussy.
These guys aren't pussies.

257
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:03,329
Darryl's not a pussy.
But we're all men!

258
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,498
We're all in the same group.
We're all on the same team.

259
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,126
We're men.
You know what?

260
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:11,546
I want Darryl
with the grizzled paw

261
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,507
to shake Ryan's hand.

262
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:15,759
It's okay.

263
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,677
You know what?
He's got soft hands.

264
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,846
You have tough hands.

265
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:21,639
Look.
Can you do that again?

266
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,725
Can you widen out?

267
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,727
I want Darryl

268
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:28,355
with the...yeah.

269
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,815
Did you get that? Yeah?

270
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,192
- Why don't we
go around the table

271
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,319
and all say something
that we know we're good at.

272
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,864
I will start.
I am good at public speaking.

273
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:40,116
- Hi, I'm Meredith,
and I'm an al--

274
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,243
good at supplier relations.

275
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,703
- Great.
Phyllis.

276
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,538
- Um, I'm good
at computer stuff.

277
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,749
Emails, uh, spreadsheets.

278
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,626
All that.
- Really?

279
00:11:49,668 --> 00:11:51,211
- I don't know.
I thought that--

280
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,879
- No. Okay, stop.

281
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:54,673
- You know, I've seen
some of your spreadsheets.

282
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,799
And I almost always--
- Really?

283
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,092
I thought they were pretty...

284
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,344
- I don't know
how I fit in with these women.

285
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,470
Here.

286
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,222
Or with Jan.

287
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:04,265
Um, I mean, we get along great.

288
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,559
Fine. Um...

289
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:11,147
I guess the person I have
the most in common with is...

290
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,399
- Jim.

291
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,942
Halpert.

292
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,027
Hey, uh, I, uh, you know,

293
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,904
heard there's a rumor
going around about,

294
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,864
you know, you used
to have a crush on Pam.

295
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,199
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No, no.

296
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,951
No, it's cool, 'cause I know
you're a good guy,

297
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,370
and I know that that crush
ended a long time ago,

298
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,579
so, you know,

299
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:29,040
we're cool, right?

300
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,001
- Yeah.
No, yeah, definitely.

301
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:32,002
- You know,
it's great with me,

302
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,253
'cause that way...

303
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,713
I'm glad
she has a friend at work

304
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,964
she can get
through the day with.

305
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:37,674
That way, she's not all,
"Bah, bah, bah, bah,"

306
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:38,758
you know, when she gets home.

307
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,176
- Yeah, I like
talking to her too.

308
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,177
- So, uh...

309
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,221
We're cool, right?
- Yes.

310
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,056
Yeah. All right.
- Good. All right.

311
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,474
- Cool, man.
- Sweet.

312
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:57,610
- The working man is
the highest form of man.

313
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,529
You know who said that?
- Stalin?

314
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,322
- Not him.
Really?

315
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:02,449
- Hey, Mike, look.

316
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,117
How about we go upstairs too,
you know?

317
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,827
Learn how an office works?
- Oh, well--

318
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,162
- We can both switch places
for the day.

319
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,080
- Okay. Yeah.
You know what?

320
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:11,249
I don't...you're...

321
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,500
My job sucks compared to this.

322
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,419
I don't think
you'd like it up there.

323
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,296
Guys! You wanna start
unloading the truck?

324
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,592
- Okay, let's go.

325
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,885
Step up.

326
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,219
- Check this out.

327
00:13:23,261 --> 00:13:25,263
Look at that.
Look at that.

328
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,139
Ba-boop!

329
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,975
"Hello, how are--"
Okay.

330
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,937
That's great.

331
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,814
That is good stuff.

332
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:37,317
- In five years,
I'd like to be

333
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,943
five years sober.

334
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,862
- That is an excellent goal.

335
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,697
- 4 1/2.

336
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,823
- I'll tell you one thing.

337
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:45,450
I am not gonna be
one of those women

338
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:47,786
schlepping her kids around
in a minivan.

339
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,871
- Great.
Uh-huh.

340
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:51,873
- I want an SUV
with three rows of seats.

341
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,541
- Mm-hmm.
- That would be great.

342
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,168
- Well, I'll be honest,
one of the goals

343
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,795
of these women's seminars is
to feel out

344
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,004
if there's any standouts,

345
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,506
women who could be
a valuable addition

346
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,924
to our corporate life.

347
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,680
- Michael wants us to bond,

348
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,682
so we need topics
for conversation.

349
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,809
- Ponies.
- No.

350
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,227
- How about rainbows?

351
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,561
- No.

352
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:15,313
- Flowers.
- No.

353
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,564
- Makeup.

354
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,109
- Something cool
that we can all connect about.

355
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,443
- Dolls.
- No.

356
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,070
Like catapults, or--

357
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:24,155
- "Power Rangers."

358
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,615
- Barrettes.
- No, you guys.

359
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:26,825
Stanley, do you have anything?

360
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,868
- Uh, retirement?

361
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,292
- That's dangerous.
Mike, come on.

362
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:37,669
Get down, please.
- No. Hey.

363
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:38,712
You're gonna hurt yourself.

364
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:39,879
- Mike--
- Stand clear.

365
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:41,214
- Mike, get off
of the lift, please!

366
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,174
- I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Come on, now.

367
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,884
- Here we go.
- Would you--look.

368
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,012
Hold on to the--
- Oh, oh, oh!

369
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,226
We'll get somebody
to clean that up.

370
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:56,021
- We're the ones
that gotta clean that up!

371
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,189
- Damn it, Michael!

372
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,607
- We have to have
this thing serviced.

373
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,779
- So, guys' gripe session.

374
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,072
Here we are.

375
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,241
Now, we definitely live

376
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,201
in different worlds,

377
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,245
but we have a lot in common.

378
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,664
We even like the same girls,

379
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:15,832
some of us.

380
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:17,125
And that's gonna happen.

381
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,252
You know, we're guys, so...

382
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:22,088
- Hey, do you want me to go?

383
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,715
- No, why would I?

384
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:26,593
You could stay, or--
- I'll go.

385
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,305
- And a big walk-in closet.

386
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:31,765
- Oh, that's part
of my dream too.

387
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,224
- Oh, me too.

388
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,477
- Great. Okay.

389
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:37,020
And, Pam, what about you?

390
00:15:37,062 --> 00:15:38,813
What is your dream?

391
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,440
- Well...

392
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:43,568
I always dreamed of a house
with a terrace upstairs.

393
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,987
Plant flowers on it,
stuff like that.

394
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,365
Since I was a girl.

395
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:51,284
Um...more seriously, though,

396
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,161
a husband that I love.

397
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,788
Roy.

398
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:55,955
And...

399
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:58,166
I love to draw.

400
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,501
And I did a little in college.

401
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,044
And I'd still love
to do something

402
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,630
where I could work with art
or graphic design in some way.

403
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:04,839
- She's real good.
- Thanks.

404
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:06,549
- You know,
the company is offering

405
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,052
a design training program
in New York.

406
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,720
- Well, I have a job
right now,

407
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,305
so I can't really
take time off.

408
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:13,807
- Well, it's--
it's only on weekends,

409
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,392
and then a few weeks
in New York,

410
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,311
but I'm sure that I could
ask corporate to help you out.

411
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,979
- Well, it's just that
the weekends aren't good

412
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,523
because, um--

413
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,650
- There are always a million
reasons not to do something.

414
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,572
- Let's start
with the warehouse.

415
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,325
What bothers you, as guys?
You know?

416
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,369
- My priority is safety.
- Okay.

417
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:36,538
- So it really bothers me
when somebody comes in here

418
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,748
speeding around on a lift,
playing with it like a toy.

419
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,333
I think it kind of gets
under my skin, okay?

420
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,626
- Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shh, shh.

421
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:43,128
- Uh-uh, don't--
don't shush me.

422
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,671
- No, I--that was just--

423
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,256
- That bothers me too.
- I was breathing.

424
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:47,841
- Pam shushes me.
It drives me crazy.

425
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,676
- I hate shushing, you know?
That's the thing.

426
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:50,719
What both--okay.

427
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,178
What is our beef,

428
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,389
as...human men?

429
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,850
- You know, that's
a good question, Hasselhoff.

430
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:59,019
[laughter]

431
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,061
- Okay.
- What bugs us?

432
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,563
- All right, good.

433
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:03,314
Guys raggin' on each other.

434
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,359
That's what guys do.
And we love it.

435
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,737
- All right,
let's talk about...

436
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,488
clothing.

437
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,115
- I'm excited about today.

438
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,617
[whispering]
I love girl talk.

439
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,871
- Dress for the job you want,
not the job you have.

440
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:19,372
All right, you can
use your clothing

441
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:20,874
to send a message
about your ambitions

442
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:24,502
by wearing clothes that reflect
what you aspire to be.

443
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,504
- I'm not gaining anything
from this seminar.

444
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:28,381
I'm a professional woman.

445
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:29,883
The head of accounting.

446
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,677
I'm in the healthiest
relationship of my life.

447
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:36,056
I just think it's insulting
that Jan thinks we need this.

448
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,474
And apparently,

449
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,642
judging from her outfit,

450
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,728
Jan aspires to be a whore.

451
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:45,398
- I hate it when girls insist
on taking them out

452
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,484
to restaurants
every weekend night,

453
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,651
and then, they're like,

454
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:49,986
"When are we gonna go
on a date-date?"

455
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:51,613
- Oh, I hate that too, man.
- Exactly!

456
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,281
- I hate that too.
- That sucks so hard.

457
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,866
- It totally sucks.
- Yeah!

458
00:17:54,908 --> 00:17:57,077
And then they make you drive
'em to church the next morning.

459
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:58,661
Like, gas ain't free!

460
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,749
- Yeah, on our salaries, man,
what do they expect, you know?

461
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,042
What, "take us out
every weekend"?

462
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,585
You know what I mean?
- I feel you, man.

463
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:06,878
- We're not millionaires.
- I feel you.

464
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,838
- No, you don't.
You don't feel us.

465
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,423
How can you?
You--you know what?

466
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,258
- Not literally.
- You say we're the same,

467
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,594
but we get compensated
very differently.

468
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,262
We work the same hours as you,

469
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,889
and you just said
we work a lot harder.

470
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,099
- Uh, you do, so--

471
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,642
- But we get paid a lot less.

472
00:18:20,684 --> 00:18:21,768
- N...y...
- Word.

473
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,728
- Like, next to no benefits.
- I know.

474
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,147
God, what is that?!
- Exactly!

475
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:27,399
- It blows.
It blows, man!

476
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,109
- You know,
this would not happen

477
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,276
if we had a union.

478
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,695
- That's what
I'm talking about.

479
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:32,987
- Yeah...no.
- Absolutely.

480
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,239
- That's what we need to do.

481
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,199
Man, see, that's
what I been sayin', man.

482
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,492
We need to do this finally.

483
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:38,910
- You know what?
Is that necessary?

484
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,621
'Cause you already sort of
have a union...of guys.

485
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,373
- It's more than necessary,
Mike.

486
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:44,541
We need this.

487
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,626
Roy, you still have that card

488
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,461
from the dock workers' union?
- In my truck.

489
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:49,879
- Man, hook it up.
Come on, man!

490
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:51,339
Let's unionize, baby!
[applause]

491
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:52,716
- Yeah, you know what,
I think, uh...

492
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:54,634
Problem is the chicks.
- That's what it's time for!

493
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,428
Union, yeah!
- The problem is the chicks.

494
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,346
And you gotta blame them.

495
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,349
- Are you with us, Mike?

496
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,476
- [weakly]
Yeah, s...

497
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,478
- Welcome to the warehouse.

498
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,523
all: [chanting]
Michael! Michael! Michael!

499
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,279
- Another issue is
inequality of pay

500
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,864
between men and women.

501
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,699
I'm sure that all of you
have dealt with that before.

502
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:19,701
[knock on door]
- This is important.

503
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:21,745
Ladies, take a breather.
[clears throat]

504
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:24,039
Jan, I, uh...

505
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,124
wanted...

506
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,793
Can I help you?

507
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,588
Um, I wanted to say
that the guys downstairs

508
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:33,423
are thinking about
forming a union.

509
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,216
And they have some good points.
- What? A union?

510
00:19:35,258 --> 00:19:36,760
- Don't get hysterical.
- I'm not.

511
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:39,554
- Part of my job is
knowing how to talk to women.

512
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:43,016
Let's...be...rational...here.

513
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,559
What are the pros?
What are the cons--

514
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:46,811
- The cons are that everyone
will lose their job, Michael.

515
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:49,981
Everyone.
Office, warehouse.

516
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:53,651
What do you think
the...pros...are...here?

517
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,071
- Don't talk to me
that way, please.

518
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,240
Just...they're gonna
wanna hear this from you.

519
00:19:59,282 --> 00:20:00,909
- Oh, you got yourself
into this, Michael,

520
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,994
so you get yourself out.
- But we're bonding down there!

521
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,038
I mean, I just don't wanna
have to tell them something

522
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,290
they're not gonna wanna hear!
- Now who's getting hysterical?

523
00:20:07,332 --> 00:20:09,209
- Okay. Come on, Jan.
After all we've been through.

524
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,877
- Michael, Michael--
- We have a history.

525
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,921
- Michael, Michael.
- We have a history between us.

526
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,256
- Don't say another word.

527
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:17,175
Get yourself downstairs.

528
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:19,344
- I'm just saying
that we have something...

529
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,929
Okay, whatever.

530
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:26,935
- British Masters is hard
to beat for long distance.

531
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,978
A great point.
- Yeah.

532
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,481
I got a spud gun in my car.
- Really?

533
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:34,609
- Yeah, shoot a chunk of potato
at your face,

534
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:36,444
80 PSI,

535
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:38,571
bon appétit.

536
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:39,864
- What are you guys
talking about?

537
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,242
both: Guns.
- Cool.

538
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:44,452
- How's that, uh,
union stuff coming?

539
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,954
- Working on it.

540
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,038
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

541
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,208
- Okay.
- All right.

542
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,710
- You ever shot a moose?

543
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,336
- No.
- [blows raspberry]

544
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,088
- You know what?

545
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,715
We could get this done
a lot quicker

546
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,049
if we formed
a type of assembly line.

547
00:20:58,091 --> 00:21:02,303
- This here is
a run-out-the-clock situation.

548
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,806
Just like upstairs.

549
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:06,933
- Sports metaphors are
one of the ways

550
00:21:06,975 --> 00:21:09,102
women feel left out
of the language of the office.

551
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:10,311
Now, I know
this might sound silly,

552
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:12,188
but many women ask
to go over it.

553
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:14,441
So "fumble" means--
- Mistake.

554
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:16,151
- Slip.
- Right.

555
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,570
"Par for the course"
is a golf term.

556
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,447
It means right on track.

557
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:23,491
Uh, "below par" means worse.

558
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,702
Wait, that should mean better.
That doesn't make sense.

559
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,287
- What about "second base"?

560
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:30,707
Like if Michael said
he got to second base with you?

561
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:32,167
Does that mean
you, like, closed a deal?

562
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:33,752
- Excuse me?
- [clears throat]

563
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,795
- I mean, that's
a baseball term, right?

564
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:38,256
- I don't know
what Michael was...

565
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:39,591
talking about.
I don't know.

566
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:40,842
- Like, you went to Chili's,

567
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:42,635
and he got to second base
with you.

568
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,179
- Excuse me.

569
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,139
- Kelly, I don't know
what Michael was talking about.

570
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,099
- He just told everybody,
and I just wanna know...

571
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:49,184
- Hey.

572
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:51,311
- Hey!
- How's it going down there?

573
00:21:51,353 --> 00:21:53,146
- It's a complete--
well, actually,

574
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:54,439
it's exactly what you'd expect.

575
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,357
So...
- Right.

576
00:21:55,398 --> 00:21:56,858
- How are the girls?
- Good.

577
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,361
We watched a video
about our changing bodies.

578
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:00,612
- Did you really?

579
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,113
- No.
- Oh.

580
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,032
- Almost.
- Oh, that's...

581
00:22:04,074 --> 00:22:07,035
- Um, but, hey, um,
something kind of cool.

582
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:09,204
There's this internship
in graphic design

583
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,914
that Jan was telling us about.

584
00:22:10,955 --> 00:22:13,416
She made it sound,
like, really great.

585
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,210
- Nice!
Well, what's it all about?

586
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,795
- Um--
- I think you should do it.

587
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:18,713
[both chuckle]
That's great!

588
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:21,049
- It's really cool.

589
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:24,427
- Cold front comin' in
to the warehouse!

590
00:22:24,469 --> 00:22:25,970
Uh-oh!

591
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,223
Better put on your ski boots!

592
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,557
[laughs]

593
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:32,477
Wooooow!

594
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,897
Happy New Year, Darryl!

595
00:22:35,939 --> 00:22:39,067
Hey, Darryl!

596
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:40,860
You ever done this?

597
00:22:42,946 --> 00:22:46,032
Better put on
your thermal jammy!

598
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,617
It's gonna get cold!

599
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,703
Snowball fight!
Whoo!

600
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,830
[laughs]

601
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:54,290
- Snow angel!
- Snow angel!

602
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:11,016
- Are you married?

603
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,392
- I'm divorced.

604
00:23:12,434 --> 00:23:14,728
- That must have been hard.
- It was. Yes.

605
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,397
- You were probably feeling
really depressed and sad,

606
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:19,983
and that's why you did
that thing with Michael.

607
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:21,609
- I think you should all
spend a little more time

608
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,446
thinking about your careers and
less time on personal stuff.

609
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:26,990
- Mm, I think we're all okay
with the balance we've struck.

610
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,742
- At least you don't have kids.

611
00:23:28,783 --> 00:23:30,618
You have no kids, right?
Thank God.

612
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,288
- Okay, I think that, you know,
finding a balance between--

613
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,707
- Jan, you and I
have so much in common.

614
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:38,835
My career is so much more
fulfilling than my family too.

615
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,295
I can't stand my kid.

616
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:42,005
- And you had
to change your name back.

617
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:43,590
That's so humiliating.

618
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:46,051
- Okay, let's take five.
I think we could all use five.

619
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:51,723
- How can someone so beautiful
be so sad?

620
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:54,893
- I know.
It's really...unsettling.

621
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:58,063
- I would not trade shoes
with her.

622
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,522
- Hey, look at us, huh?

623
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:01,816
All working together,
getting along.

624
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,027
United.
Band of brothers.

625
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,946
- Like a union.
- Better.

626
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,323
- Hey, what the hell, man?

627
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:09,908
- You don't tell her
what to do, all right?

628
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,326
- I was just giving her
my opinion.

629
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:12,952
- Yeah, well, it has nothing
to do with you!

630
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,412
That's between her and me,
all right?

631
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:15,497
You got to respect that!

632
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:19,167
- All right. Come on, you guys.
Break it up!

633
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:21,211
- Guys, check it out!

634
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,712
Spud gun.

635
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:24,589
Whoo-hoo!
Bon appétit!

636
00:24:29,636 --> 00:24:30,595
[quietly]
Sorry.

637
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,477
- That's my office.

638
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,197
- Hi.

639
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,573
- Did you take care
of the situation?

640
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:51,533
- Yeah, yeah.

641
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,284
Yes, I...

642
00:24:53,326 --> 00:24:55,370
I have essentially--
- Excuse me.

643
00:24:55,412 --> 00:24:56,996
Excuse me.
- Yes, I've take--

644
00:24:57,038 --> 00:24:58,707
- I'm told that
there's been some interest

645
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:01,459
in forming a union,
and that Michael supported it.

646
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:02,836
Obviously, he's not
a friend of yours,

647
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:05,630
because he didn't tell you
the facts, so let me.

648
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,550
If there is even a whiff
of unionizing in this branch,

649
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:11,219
I can guarantee you the branch
will be shut down like that.

650
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:12,512
They unionized in Pittsfield,

651
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:14,472
and we all know
what happened in Pittsfield.

652
00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:17,267
It will cost each of you
a fortune in legal fees

653
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:19,019
and union dues,
and that'll be nothing

654
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,395
compared to the cost
of losing your jobs.

655
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:22,564
So I would think long and hard

656
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:25,150
before sacrificing your savings
and your futures

657
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:27,402
just to send a message.

658
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:28,778
If you have
any further questions,

659
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,073
you can direct them to...

660
00:25:32,115 --> 00:25:33,366
To Michael.

661
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:38,246
- Oh, that.
The terrace?

662
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,540
I don't even know
why I brought that up.

663
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:43,209
Um, dreams are just that.

664
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:44,419
They're dreams.

665
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:46,546
They help
get you through the day.

666
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:47,881
Like the thing
about the terrace.

667
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:49,090
It's nice,

668
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:51,301
but, um, I don't know.

669
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:53,928
It was just something I read
in this book when I was 12.

670
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,056
Uh, the girl in the book
has a terrace

671
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:57,515
outside of her bedroom.

672
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:00,310
And she planted flowers on it.

673
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:02,437
And I just loved that.

674
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,314
It just always kind of stuck
with me.

675
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,274
- So you're not doing it?

676
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:10,570
- How did you know?

677
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:11,821
- Why not?

678
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:14,407
- Just not--no big reason.

679
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,451
Just a bunch of little reasons.

680
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,536
- Come on.
- Roy's right.

681
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:21,039
There's no guarantee it's
gonna lead to anything anyway.

682
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:24,125
- Roy said that?

683
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:26,294
- What? You have something
you wanna say?

684
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:31,633
- You gotta take a chance
on something sometime, Pam.

685
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:34,636
I mean, do you wanna be
a receptionist here, always?

686
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:35,970
- Oh, excuse me!

687
00:26:36,012 --> 00:26:38,723
I'm fine with my choices.

688
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,517
- You are?

689
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:42,686
- Yeah.

690
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:44,104
It's impractical.

691
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:47,774
I'm not gonna...
try to get a house like that.

692
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:50,777
Um, they don't even make houses
like that in Scranton,

693
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:52,529
so I'm never gonna...

694
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:05,542
- Rule number one
of the warehouse:

695
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,837
never outload
the outgoing order.

696
00:27:08,878 --> 00:27:11,047
[laughter]

697
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:13,383
Y'all look a little sweaty.

698
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:15,218
We didn't tell you
to take it off the truck.

699
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,845
- Give yourselves
a round of applause!

700
00:27:16,886 --> 00:27:18,346
- Very nice work.
[applause]

701
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:21,182
[laughter]
- Whoo!

702
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:23,226
- Those are the smart ones.
- Man!

703
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,740
- I'm just gonna push this
over there!

704
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:41,161
- This is not a good idea
right here.

705
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:45,540
- Easy does it. Okay.

706
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,131
Pizza.

707
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:55,467
Great equalizer.

708
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,219
Rich people love pizza.
Poor people love pizza.

709
00:27:58,261 --> 00:28:01,848
White people love pizza.
Black people love pizza.

710
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,392
Do Black people like pizza?

711
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:17,238
Hey, um...

712
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,908
Look, guys, I'm sorry.

713
00:28:19,949 --> 00:28:21,326
Sometimes, Jan...

714
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:23,203
[lowers voice]
can be such a bitch.

715
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:25,497
[all agree]

716
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:27,123
Hey, watch it.
Watch it.

717
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:28,583
We have a relationship.

718
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:33,046
Well, we need to head upstairs.

719
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:34,547
Stanley, you wanna...

720
00:28:34,589 --> 00:28:37,926
hang out with your friends
for a bit?

721
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,344
All right.

722
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,641
Thank you to our hosts.

723
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:46,267
- Hey, Michael!

724
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:47,686
This ain't over.

725
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:58,029
- [sighs]
Excellent.

726
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,323
Excellent.
Productive.

727
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:02,659
Informative day.

728
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:05,328
- There was this film
that I saw when I was little.

729
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,163
It was about a kid

730
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:10,458
who goes the most
incredible adventure.

731
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,377
And even though
it was really great

732
00:29:12,419 --> 00:29:14,587
and she had a great time,

733
00:29:14,629 --> 00:29:16,631
she ends up back home in Kansas
and says,

734
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,800
"There's no place like home."

735
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:21,511
And that's how I feel
right now.

736
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:23,930
There is no place like home.

737
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,226
What the hell
was that movie called?

738
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:29,769
So...

739
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:33,189
[sighs]
It's gonna drive me crazy.

740
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,652
- I love her shoes.

741
00:29:37,694 --> 00:29:38,903
- Me too.

742
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:40,780
- I don't.

743
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:43,950
- Uh, maybe I don't.

744
00:29:43,992 --> 00:29:46,202
- I'm happy this thing is over.

745
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:48,163
I understand
where Jan was coming from,

746
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:50,749
but I didn't like it so much.

747
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:53,043
I mean, she made me feel bad
for being happy

748
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:54,711
with where I am.

749
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:56,212
- Is it good to be back?
Yeah.

750
00:29:56,254 --> 00:29:58,548
I mean,
I love the guy stuff, but...

751
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,800
to run an office,
you need men and women.

752
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:02,218
You know why?

753
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:05,472
Because you need to have
that crazy sexual tension

754
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:07,599
to keep things interesting.

755
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,975
- [sighs]

756
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:14,856
[telephone rings]

757
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:20,236
- Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.

758
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,573
Uh, hold, please.

759
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,378
- Why are you even
filming this?

760
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:39,130
I'm walking. Let's see how
interesting I can make this.

761
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:45,220
How's that?
Is that getting better?

762
00:30:45,261 --> 00:30:47,764
How about that?
When I turn the corner?

763
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:49,766
I pretend
I'm a racecar sometime.

764
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:52,894
[imitates engine revving]

765
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:55,271
[imitates tires squealing]

766
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:58,191
[imitates engine revving]

767
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,196
And I'm fat, so sometime,
I got to take a breath.

768
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:05,907
[inhales deeply, exhales]

769
00:31:05,949 --> 00:31:08,034
- What?

770
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:10,453
Don't tape me.

771
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:12,539
I'm wanted in three states.

772
00:31:16,584 --> 00:31:18,670
- What's everybody's
favorite flavor?

773
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:04,257
[bugle toots]

774
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:05,300
[ascending tone]
